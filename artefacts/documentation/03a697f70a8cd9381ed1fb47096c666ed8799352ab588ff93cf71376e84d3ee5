     * Called when switching to a different foreground user, for system services that have
     * special behavior for whichever user is currently in the foreground.  This is called
     * before any application processes are aware of the new user.
     *
     * <p>This method is only called when the service {@link #isUserSupported(TargetUser) supports}
     * either of the users ({@code from} or {@code to}).
     *
     * <b>NOTE: </b> both {@code from} and {@code to} are "live" objects
     * referenced by {@link UserManagerService} and hence should not be modified.
