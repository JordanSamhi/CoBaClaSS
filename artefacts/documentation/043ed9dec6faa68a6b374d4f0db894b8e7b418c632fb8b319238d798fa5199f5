     * Return the fractional position of "now" within the "run time" window of
     * this job.
     * <p>
     * For example, if the earliest run time was 10 minutes ago, and the latest
     * run time is 30 minutes from now, this would return 0.25.
     * <p>
     * If the job has no window defined, returns 1. When only an earliest or
     * latest time is defined, it's treated as an infinitely small window at
     * that time.
