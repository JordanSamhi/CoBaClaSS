     * Calculate a rectangle for the given input and output parameters. The output
     * rectangle to use is written in the given outRect.
     *
     * @param srcW the source width
     * @param srcH the source height
     * @param dstW the destination width
     * @param dstH the destination height
     * @param dstSliceH the height extent (in destination coordinates) to
     *            exclude when cropping. You would typically pass dstH, unless
     *            you are trying to normalize different items to the same
     *            vertical crop range.
     * @param sampleSize a scaling factor that rect calculation will only use if
     *            it's more aggressive than regular scaling
     * @param horizSliceFrac horizontal slice fraction determines the horizontal
     *            center point for the crop rect. Range is from [0.0, 1.0]. To
     *            perform a horizontally centered crop, use 0.5.
     * @param vertSliceFrac vertical slice fraction determines the vertical
     *            center point for the crop rect. Range is from [0.0, 1.0]. To
     *            perform a vertically centered crop, use 0.5. Otherwise, see
     *            absoluteFrac.
     * @param absoluteFrac determines how the vertSliceFrac affects the vertical
     *            center point. If this parameter is true, the vertical center
     *            of the resulting output rectangle will be exactly
     *            [vertSliceFrac * srcH], with care taken to keep the bounds
     *            within the source rectangle. If this parameter is false, the
     *            vertical center will be calculated so that the values of
     *            vertSliceFrac from 0.0 to 1.0 will linearly cover the entirety
     *            of the source rectangle.
     * @param verticalMultiplier an optional multiplier that will alter the
     *            output Rect's aspect ratio to be this much taller in the event
     *            that y is the limiting dimension
     * @param outRect a Rect to write the resulting crop coordinates into
