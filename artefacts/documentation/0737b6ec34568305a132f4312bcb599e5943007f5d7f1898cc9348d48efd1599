     * Sets the timeout for waiting for a widget to become visible in the user
     * interface so that it can be matched by a selector.
     *
     * Because user interface content is dynamic, sometimes a widget may not
     * be visible immediately and won't be detected by a selector. This timeout
     * allows the uiautomator framework to wait for a match to be found, up until
     * the timeout elapses.
     *
     * @param timeout Timeout value in milliseconds.
