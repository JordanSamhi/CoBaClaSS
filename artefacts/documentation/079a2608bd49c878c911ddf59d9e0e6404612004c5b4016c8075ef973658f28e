 Sets the resolved photo URI. This method is for the case
         *  where the URI given to {@link PhotoViewActivity} points directly
         *  to a single image and does not need to be resolved via a query
         *  to the {@link ContentProvider}. If this value is set, it supersedes
         *  {@link #setPhotosUri(String)}.
