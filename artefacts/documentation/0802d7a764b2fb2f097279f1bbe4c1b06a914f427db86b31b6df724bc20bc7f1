     * Gets the default system-wide proxy.
     *
     * This will return the global proxy if set, otherwise the default proxy if in use. Note
     * that this is not necessarily the proxy that any given process should use, as the right
     * proxy for a process is the proxy for the network this process will use, which may be
     * different from this value. This value is simply the default in case there is no proxy set
     * in the network that will be used by a specific process.
     * @return The default system-wide proxy or null if none.
