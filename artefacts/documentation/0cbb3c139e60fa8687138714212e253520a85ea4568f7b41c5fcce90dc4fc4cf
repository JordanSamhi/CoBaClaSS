     * Returns an index for which {@link #valueAt} would return the
     * specified value, or a negative number if no keys map to the
     * specified value.
     * <p>Beware that this is a linear search, unlike lookups by key,
     * and that multiple keys can map to the same value and this will
     * find only one of them.
     * <p>Note also that this method uses {@code equals} unlike {@code indexOfValue}.
