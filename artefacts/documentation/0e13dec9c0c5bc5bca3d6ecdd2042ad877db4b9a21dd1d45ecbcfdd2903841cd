     * Get CellIdentity from the ServiceState if available or guess from CellInfo
     *
     * Get the CellLocation by first checking if ServiceState has a current CID. If so
     * then return that info. Otherwise, query AllCellInfo and return the first GSM or
     * WCDMA result that appears. If no GSM or WCDMA results, then return an LTE result.
     * The behavior is kept consistent for backwards compatibility; (do not apply logic
     * to determine why the behavior is this way).

     * @param workSource calling WorkSource
     * @param rspMsg the response message which must be non-null
