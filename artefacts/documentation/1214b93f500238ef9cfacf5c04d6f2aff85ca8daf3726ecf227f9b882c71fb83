     * Build WifiRadioUsage proto
     * A snapshot of Wifi statistics in Batterystats is obtained. Due to reboots multiple correlated
     * logs may be uploaded in a day. Server side should analyze based the ratio of collected
     * properties over the total logging duration (ie. |scanTimeMs| / |loggingDurationMs|)
     *
     * This proto contains additional wifi usage data that are not directly related to power
     * calculations.
     * @return WifiRadioUsage
