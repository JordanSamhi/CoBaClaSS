     * Tracks an instance that has a high leak risk (i.e. has complex ownership and references
     * a large amount of memory).
     *
     * The LeakDetector will monitor and keep weak references to such instances, dump statistics
     * about them in a bugreport, and in the future dump the heap if their count starts growing
     * unreasonably.
     *
     * This should be called when the instance is first constructed.
