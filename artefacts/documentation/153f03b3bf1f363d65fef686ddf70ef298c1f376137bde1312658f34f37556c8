     * Sets the bounds at the current hierarchy level, overriding any bounds set on an ancestor.
     * This value will be reported when {@link #getBounds()} and
     * {@link #getRequestedOverrideBounds()}. If
     * an empty {@link Rect} or null is specified, this container will be considered to match its
     * parent bounds {@see #matchParentBounds} and will inherit bounds from its parent.
     * @param bounds The bounds defining the container size.
     * @return a bitmask representing the types of changes made to the bounds.
