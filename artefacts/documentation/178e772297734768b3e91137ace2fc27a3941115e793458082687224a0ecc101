     * captures location information the responder is programmed to broadcast. The responder
     * location is referred to as unverified, because we are relying on the device/site
     * administrator to correctly configure its location data.
     * <p>
     * Will return a {@code null} when the location information cannot be parsed.
     * <p>
     * Only valid if {@link #getStatus()} returns {@link #STATUS_SUCCESS}, otherwise will throw an
     * exception.
