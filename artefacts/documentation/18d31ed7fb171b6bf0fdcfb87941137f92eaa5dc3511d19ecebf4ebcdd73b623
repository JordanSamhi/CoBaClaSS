     * Call this method before the first call to {@link #getActivity} to set the initial touch
     * mode for the Activity under test.
     *
     * <p>If you do not call this, the touch mode will be false.  If you call this after
     * your Activity has been started, it will have no effect.
     *
     * <p><b>NOTE:</b> Activities under test may not be started from within the UI thread.
     * If your test method is annotated with {@link android.test.UiThreadTest}, then you must call
     * {@link #setActivityInitialTouchMode(boolean)} from {@link #setUp()}.
     *
     * @param initialTouchMode true if the Activity should be placed into "touch mode" when started
