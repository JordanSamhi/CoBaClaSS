     * @return whether a UID is in active or not *based on cached information.*
     *
     * Note this information is based on the UID proc state callback, meaning it's updated
     * asynchronously and may subtly be stale. If the fresh data is needed, use
     * {@link #isUidActiveSynced} instead.
