     * A helper function for implementing {@link #openTypedAssetFile}, for
     * creating a data pipe and background thread allowing you to stream
     * generated data back to the client.  This function returns a new
     * ParcelFileDescriptor that should be returned to the caller (the caller
     * is responsible for closing it).
     *
     * @param uri The URI whose data is to be written.
     * @param mimeType The desired type of data to be written.
     * @param opts Options supplied by caller.
     * @param args Your own custom arguments.
     * @param func Interface implementing the function that will actually
     * stream the data.
     * @return Returns a new ParcelFileDescriptor holding the read side of
     * the pipe.  This should be returned to the caller for reading; the caller
     * is responsible for closing it when done.
