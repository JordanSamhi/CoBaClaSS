     * Set the ca_path directive on wpa_supplicant.
     *
     * From wpa_supplicant documentation:
     *
     * Directory path for CA certificate files (PEM). This path may contain
     * multiple CA certificates in OpenSSL format. Common use for this is to
     * point to system trusted CA list which is often installed into directory
     * like /etc/ssl/certs. If configured, these certificates are added to the
     * list of trusted CAs. ca_cert may also be included in that case, but it is
     * not required.
     *
     * Note: If no certificate path is set for an Enterprise configuration, either by not calling
     * this API, or by calling it with null, and no certificate is set by
     * {@link #setCaCertificate(X509Certificate)} or {@link #setCaCertificates(X509Certificate[])},
     * then the server certificate validation is skipped - which means that the connection is not
     * secure.
     *
     * @param path The path for CA certificate files, or empty string to clear.
