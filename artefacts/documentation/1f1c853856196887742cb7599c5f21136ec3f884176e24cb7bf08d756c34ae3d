     * Removes the transform and sets the previously known surface position for {@link WindowState}
     * surface that undoes the effect of the global display rotation.
     *
     * Removing the transform and the result of the {@link WindowState} layout are both tied to the
     * {@link WindowState} next frame, such that they apply at the same time the client draws the
     * window in the new orientation.
     *
     * In the case of a rotation timeout, we want to remove the transform immediately and not defer
     * it.
