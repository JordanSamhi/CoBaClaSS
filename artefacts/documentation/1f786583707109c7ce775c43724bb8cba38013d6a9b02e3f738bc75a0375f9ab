         * Note: We should ideally listen to
         * {@link NetdEventObserver#interfaceStatusChanged(String, boolean)} here. But, that
         * callback is not working currently (broken in netd). So, instead listen to link state
         * change callbacks as triggers to query the real interface state. We should get rid of
         * this workaround if we get the |interfaceStatusChanged| callback to work in netd.
         * Also, this workaround will not detect an interface up event, if the link state is
         * still down.
