     * Adjusts ABIs for a set of packages belonging to a shared user so that they all match.
     * i.e, so that all packages can be run inside a single process if required.
     *
     * Optionally, callers can pass in a parsed package via {@code newPackage} in which case
     * this function will either try and make the ABI for all packages in
     * {@code packagesForUser} match {@code scannedPackage} or will update the ABI of
     * {@code scannedPackage} to match the ABI selected for {@code packagesForUser}. This
     * variant is used when installing or updating a package that belongs to a shared user.
     *
     * NOTE: We currently only match for the primary CPU abi string. Matching the secondary
     * adds unnecessary complexity.
