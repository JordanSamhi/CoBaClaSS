     * Converts error codes from BiometricConstants, which are used in most of the internal plumbing
     * and eventually returned to {@link BiometricPrompt.AuthenticationCallback} to public
     * {@link BiometricManager} constants, which are used by APIs such as
     * {@link BiometricManager#canAuthenticate(int)}
     *
     * @param biometricConstantsCode see {@link BiometricConstants}
