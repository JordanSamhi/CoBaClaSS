     * Request a scan for access points. Returns immediately. The availability
     * of the results is made known later by means of an asynchronous event sent
     * on completion of the scan.
     * <p>
     * To initiate a Wi-Fi scan, declare the
     * {@link android.Manifest.permission#CHANGE_WIFI_STATE}
     * permission in the manifest, and perform these steps:
     * </p>
     * <ol style="1">
     * <li>Invoke the following method:
     * {@code ((WifiManager) getSystemService(WIFI_SERVICE)).startScan()}</li>
     * <li>
     * Register a BroadcastReceiver to listen to
     * {@code SCAN_RESULTS_AVAILABLE_ACTION}.</li>
     * <li>When a broadcast is received, call:
     * {@code ((WifiManager) getSystemService(WIFI_SERVICE)).getScanResults()}</li>
     * </ol>
     * @return {@code true} if the operation succeeded, i.e., the scan was initiated.
     * @deprecated The ability for apps to trigger scan requests will be removed in a future
     * release.
