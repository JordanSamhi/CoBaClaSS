     * <p> The function call immediately returns after sending a request to start a
     * WPS session. Currently, this is only valid if the current device is running
     * as a group owner to allow any new clients to join the group. The application
     * is notified of a success or failure to initiate WPS through listener callbacks
     * {@link ActionListener#onSuccess} or {@link ActionListener#onFailure}.
