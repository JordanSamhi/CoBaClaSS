     * Notifies the listener that some parameters/state has changed for some notification and that
     * content needs to be bound again.
     *
     * The caller can also specify a callback for when the entire bind pipeline completes, i.e.
     * when the change is fully propagated to the final view. The caller can cancel this
     * callback with the returned cancellation signal.
     *
     * @param callback callback after bind completely finishes
     * @return cancellation signal to cancel callback
