     * <b>Note:</b> Network communication may not use Wi-Fi even if Wi-Fi is connected;
     * traffic may instead be sent through another network, such as cellular data,
     * Bluetooth tethering, or Ethernet. For example, traffic will never use a
     * Wi-Fi network that does not provide Internet access (e.g. a wireless
     * printer), if another network that does offer Internet access (e.g.
     * cellular data) is available. Applications that need to ensure that their
     * network traffic uses Wi-Fi should use APIs such as
     * {@link Network#bindSocket(java.net.Socket)},
     * {@link Network#openConnection(java.net.URL)}, or
     * {@link ConnectivityManager#bindProcessToNetwork} to do so.
