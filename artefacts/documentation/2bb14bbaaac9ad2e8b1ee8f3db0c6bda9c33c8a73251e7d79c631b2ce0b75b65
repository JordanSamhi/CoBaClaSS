     * Runs the given function synchronously if currently connected, and returns the default value
     * if not currently connected or if any exception is thrown. Do not obtain any locks within the
     * BlockingBinderRunner, or risk deadlock. The default value will be returned if there is no
     * service connection when this is run, if a RemoteException occurs, or if the operation times
     * out.

     * @deprecated Using this function is an indication that your AIDL API is broken. Calls from
     * system server to outside MUST be one-way, and so cannot return any result, and this
     * method should not be needed or used. Use a separate callback interface to allow outside
     * components to return results back to the system server.
