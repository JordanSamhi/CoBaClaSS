     * Performs a multi-touch gesture
     *
     * Takes a series of touch coordinates for at least 2 pointers. Each pointer must have
     * all of its touch steps defined in an array of {@link PointerCoords}. By having the ability
     * to specify the touch points along the path of a pointer, the caller is able to specify
     * complex gestures like circles, irregular shapes etc, where each pointer may take a
     * different path.
     *
     * To create a single point on a pointer's touch path
     * <code>
     *       PointerCoords p = new PointerCoords();
     *       p.x = stepX;
     *       p.y = stepY;
     *       p.pressure = 1;
     *       p.size = 1;
     * </code>
     * @param touches each array of {@link PointerCoords} constitute a single pointer's touch path.
     *        Multiple {@link PointerCoords} arrays constitute multiple pointers, each with its own
     *        path. Each {@link PointerCoords} in an array constitute a point on a pointer's path.
     * @return <code>true</code> if all points on all paths are injected successfully, <code>false
     *        </code>otherwise
     * @since API Level 18
