     * active. This must be called each time statsd starts. This operation allows
     * statsd to inform clients that they should pull data of the configs that are currently
     * active. The activeConfigsChangedOperation should set periodic alarms to pull data of configs
     * that are active and stop pulling data of configs that are no longer active.
