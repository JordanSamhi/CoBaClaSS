     * <p>Providing a {@code null} {@code value} will indicate a forced use of
     * the template's selection for that {@code key}; the difference here is
     * that this information will be propagated with unions as documented in
     * {@link #union}. This method increments the revision identifier if the new
     * choice is different than the existing selection.</p>

     * @param key Which setting to alter.
     * @param value The new selection for that setting, or {@code null} to force
     *              the use of the template's default selection for this field.
     * @return Whether the settings were updated, which only occurs if the
     *         {@code value} is different from any already stored.
     *
     * @throws NullPointerException If {@code key} is {@code null}.
