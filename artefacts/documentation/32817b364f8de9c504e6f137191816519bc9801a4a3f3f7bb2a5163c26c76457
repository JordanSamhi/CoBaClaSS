     * Set a property on a view, updating its value, even if it's already animating.
     * The @param animated can be used to request an animation.
     * If the view isn't animated, this utility will update the current animation if existent,
     * such that the end value will point to @param newEndValue or apply it directly if there's
     * no animation.
