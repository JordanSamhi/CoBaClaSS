     * Add a listener and a rank based on the priority of this message
     * @param listener the listener
     * @param rank the order in which you'd like to be called. Ranked listeners will be
     * notified before unranked, and we will sort ranked listeners from low to high
     *
     * @deprecated This method exists only to solve latent inter-dependencies from refactoring
     * StatusBarState out of StatusBar.java. Any new listeners should be built not to need ranking
     * (i.e., they are non-dependent on the order of operations of StatusBarState listeners).
