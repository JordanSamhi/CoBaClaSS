         * A factory method that internally enforces two-phase initialization to make sure that the
         * object reference will not be escaped until the object is properly constructed.
         *
         * <p>NOTE: Currently {@link SettingsObserver} is accessed only from main thread.  Hence
         * this enforcement of two-phase initialization may be unnecessary at the moment.</p>
         *
         * @param service {@link InputMethodService} that needs to receive the callback.
         * @return {@link SettingsObserver} that is already registered to
         * {@link android.content.ContentResolver}. The caller must call
         * {@link SettingsObserver#unregister()}.
