     * Instead of filtering on the entire contents of the edit box,
     * this subclass method filters on the range from
     * {@link Tokenizer#findTokenStart} to {@link #getSelectionEnd}
     * if the length of that range meets or exceeds {@link #getThreshold}
     * and makes sure that the range is not already a Chip.
