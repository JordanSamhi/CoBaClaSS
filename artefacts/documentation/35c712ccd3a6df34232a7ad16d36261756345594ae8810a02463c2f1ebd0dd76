     * The top-left of the transformed full rectangle will always be placed at (0, 0).
     * @param orientation The exif orientation (0, 90, 180, 270) of the original image. The
     *                    transformed full and partial rectangles will be in this orientation's
     *                    coordinate space.
     * @param fullRect    The upright full rectangle. This rectangle will be modified.
     * @param partialRect The upright partial rectangle. This rectangle will be modified.
