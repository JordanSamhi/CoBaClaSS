         * Sets the indices of the actions involved in this event. Actions are usually returned by
         * the text classifier in priority order with the most preferred action at index 0.
         * These indices give an indication of the position of the actions that are being reported.

         * <pre>
         *   // 3 smart actions are shown at index 0, 1, 2 respectively in response to a link click.
         *   new TextClassifierEvent.Builder(CATEGORY_LINKIFY, TYPE_ACTIONS_SHOWN)

         *       ...
         *       .build();
         *
         *   ...
         *
         *   // Smart action at index 1 is activated.
         *   new TextClassifierEvent.Builder(CATEGORY_LINKIFY, TYPE_SMART_ACTION)
