     * Configures an always-on VPN connection through a specific application. This connection is
     * automatically granted and persisted after a reboot.
     *
     * <p>The designated package should either have a PlatformVpnProfile installed, or declare a
     * {@link VpnService} in its manifest guarded by {@link
     * android.Manifest.permission.BIND_VPN_SERVICE}, otherwise the call will fail.
     *
     * <p>Note that this method does not check if the VPN app supports always-on mode. The check is
     * delayed to {@link #startAlwaysOnVpn()}, which is always called immediately after this method
     * in {@link android.net.IConnectivityManager#setAlwaysOnVpnPackage}.
     *
     * @param packageName the package to designate as always-on VPN supplier.
     * @param lockdown whether to prevent traffic outside of a VPN, for example while connecting.
     * @param lockdownWhitelist packages to be whitelisted from lockdown.
     * @param keyStore the Keystore instance to use for checking of PlatformVpnProfile(s)
     * @return {@code true} if the package has been set as always-on, {@code false} otherwise.
