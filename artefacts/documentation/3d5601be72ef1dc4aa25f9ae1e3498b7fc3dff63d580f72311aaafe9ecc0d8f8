     * Creates a wrapper that contains the caller context and a normalized request.
     * The request should be returned to the caller app, and the wrapper should be sent to this
     * object through #addObserver by the service handler.
     *
     * <p>It will register the observer asynchronously, so it is safe to call from any thread.
     *
     * @return the normalized request wrapped within {@link RequestInfo}.
