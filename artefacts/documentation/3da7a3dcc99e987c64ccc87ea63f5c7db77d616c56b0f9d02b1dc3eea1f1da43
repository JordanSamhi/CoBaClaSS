     * A function for converting from the gamma space that the slider works in to the
     * linear space that the setting works in.
     *
     * The gamma space effectively provides us a way to make linear changes to the slider that
     * result in linear changes in perception. If we made changes to the slider in the linear space
     * then we'd see an approximately logarithmic change in perception (c.f. Fechner's Law).
     *
     * Internally, this implements the Hybrid Log Gamma electro-optical transfer function, which is
     * a slight improvement to the typical gamma transfer function for displays whose max
     * brightness exceeds the 120 nit reference point, but doesn't set a specific reference
     * brightness like the PQ function does.
     *
     * Note that this transfer function is only valid if the display's backlight value is a linear
     * control. If it's calibrated to be something non-linear, then a different transfer function
     * should be used.
     *
     * @param val The slider value.
     * @param min The minimum acceptable value for the setting.
     * @param max The maximum acceptable value for the setting.
     * @return The corresponding setting value.
