     * Ask the transport to provide data for the "current" package being restored.  The
     * transport then writes some data to the socket supplied to this call, and returns
     * the number of bytes written.  The system will then read that many bytes and
     * stream them to the application's agent for restore, then will call this method again
     * to receive the next chunk of the archive.  This sequence will be repeated until the
     * transport returns zero indicating that all of the package's data has been delivered
     * (or returns a negative value indicating some sort of hard error condition at the
     * transport level).
     *
     * <p>After this method returns zero, the system will then call
     * {@link #getNextFullRestorePackage()} to begin the restore process for the next
     * application, and the sequence begins again.
     *
     * @param socket The file descriptor that the transport will use for delivering the
     *    streamed archive.
     * @return 0 when no more data for the current package is available.  A positive value
     *    indicates the presence of that much data to be delivered to the app.  A negative
     *    return value is treated as equivalent to {@link BackupTransport#TRANSPORT_ERROR},
     *    indicating a fatal error condition that precludes further restore operations
     *    on the current dataset.
