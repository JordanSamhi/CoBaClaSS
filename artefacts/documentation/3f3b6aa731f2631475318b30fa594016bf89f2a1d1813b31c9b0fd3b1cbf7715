     * Performs a multi-touch gesture. You must specify touch coordinates for
     * at least 2 pointers. Each pointer must have all of its touch steps
     * defined in an array of {@link PointerCoords}. You can use this method to
     * specify complex gestures, like circles and irregular shapes, where each
     * pointer may take a different path.
     *
     * To create a single point on a pointer's touch path:
     * <code>
     *       PointerCoords p = new PointerCoords();
     *       p.x = stepX;
     *       p.y = stepY;
     *       p.pressure = 1;
     *       p.size = 1;
     * </code>
     * @param touches represents the pointers' paths. Each {@link PointerCoords}
     * array represents a different pointer. Each {@link PointerCoords} in an
     * array element represents a touch point on a pointer's path.
     * @return <code>true</code> if all touch events for this gesture are injected successfully,
     *         <code>false</code> otherwise
