     * A DO/PO can get the scopes of any package. A non DO/PO package can get its own scopes by
     * passing in {@code null} as the {@code who} parameter and its own name as the
     * {@code delegatepackage}.
     *
     * @param who the device owner or profile owner, or {@code null} if the caller is
     *            {@code delegatePackage}.
     * @param delegatePackage the name of the delegate package whose scopes are to be retrieved.
     * @return a list of the delegation scopes currently given to {@code delegatePackage}.
