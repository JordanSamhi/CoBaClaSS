     * Set an override tint color that is used for the background.
     *
     * @param color the color that should be used to tint the background.
     *              This can be {@link #NO_COLOR} if the tint should be normally computed.
     * @param overrideAmount a value from 0 to 1 how much the override tint should be used. The
     *                       background color will then be the interpolation between this and the
     *                       regular background color, where 1 means the overrideTintColor is fully
     *                       used and the background color not at all.
