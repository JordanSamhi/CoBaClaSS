     * Utility for testing equals() and hashCode() results at once.
     * Tests that lhs.equals(rhs) matches expectedResult, as well as
     * rhs.equals(lhs).  Also tests that hashCode() return values are
     * equal if expectedResult is true.  (hashCode() is not tested if
     * expectedResult is false, as unequal objects can have equal hashCodes.)
     *
     * @param lhs An Object for which equals() and hashCode() are to be tested.
     * @param rhs As lhs.
     * @param expectedResult True if the objects should compare equal,
     *   false if not.
