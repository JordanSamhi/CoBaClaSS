     * Called when a discovery (publish or subscribe) operation results in a
     * service discovery. Called when a Subscribe service was configured with a range requirement
     * {@link SubscribeConfig.Builder#setMinDistanceMm(int)} and/or
     * {@link SubscribeConfig.Builder#setMaxDistanceMm(int)} and the Publish service was configured
     * with {@link PublishConfig.Builder#setRangingEnabled(boolean)}.
     * <p>
     * If either Publisher or Subscriber does not enable Ranging, or if Ranging is temporarily
     * disabled by the underlying device, service discovery proceeds without ranging and the
     * {@link #onServiceDiscovered(PeerHandle, byte[], List)} is called.
     * <p>
     * Note that this method and {@link #onServiceDiscovered(PeerHandle, byte[], List)} may be
     * called multiple times per service discovery.
     *
     * @param peerHandle An opaque handle to the peer matching our discovery operation.
     * @param serviceSpecificInfo The service specific information (arbitrary
     *            byte array) provided by the peer as part of its discovery
     *            configuration.
     * @param matchFilter The filter which resulted in this service discovery. For
     * {@link PublishConfig#PUBLISH_TYPE_UNSOLICITED},
     * {@link SubscribeConfig#SUBSCRIBE_TYPE_PASSIVE} discovery sessions this is the publisher's
     *                    match filter. For {@link PublishConfig#PUBLISH_TYPE_SOLICITED},
     *                    {@link SubscribeConfig#SUBSCRIBE_TYPE_ACTIVE} discovery sessions this
     *                    is the subscriber's match filter.
     * @param distanceMm The measured distance to the Publisher in mm. Note: the measured distance
     *                   may be negative for very close devices.
