         * Add the device specified by the {@code peerMacAddress} to the list of devices with
         * which to measure range.
         * <p>
         * The MAC address may be obtained out-of-band from a peer Wi-Fi Aware device. A Wi-Fi
         * Aware device may obtain its MAC address using the {@link IdentityChangedListener}
         * provided to
         * {@link WifiAwareManager#attach(AttachCallback, IdentityChangedListener, Handler)}.
         * <p>
         * Note: in order to use this API the device must support Wi-Fi Aware
         * {@link android.net.wifi.aware}. The peer device which is being ranged to must be
         * configured to publish a service (with any name) with:
         * <li>Type {@link android.net.wifi.aware.PublishConfig#PUBLISH_TYPE_UNSOLICITED}.
         * <li>Ranging enabled
         * {@link android.net.wifi.aware.PublishConfig.Builder#setRangingEnabled(boolean)}.
         *
         * @param peerMacAddress The MAC address of the Wi-Fi Aware peer.
         * @return The builder, to facilitate chaining {@code builder.setXXX(..).setXXX(..)}.
