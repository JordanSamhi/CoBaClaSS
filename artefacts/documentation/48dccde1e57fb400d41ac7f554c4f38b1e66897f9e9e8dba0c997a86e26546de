     * <p>Converts the specified color long from a color space to another using the
     * specified color space {@link ColorSpace.Connector connector}. The resulting
     * color is returned as a color long. See the documentation of this class for a
     * description of the color long format.</p>
     *
     * <p>When converting several colors in a row, this method is preferable to
     * {@link #convert(long, ColorSpace)} as it prevents a new connector from being
     * created on every invocation.</p>
     *
     * <p class="note">The connector's source color space should match the color long's
     * color space.</p>
     *
     * @param color The color long to convert
     * @param connector A color space connector, cannot be null
     * @return A color long in the destination color space of the connector
