     * Execute {@code transportConsumer} for each registered transport passing the transport name.
     * This is called with an internal lock held, ensuring that the transport will remain registered
     * while {@code transportConsumer} is being executed. Don't do heavy operations in {@code
     * transportConsumer}.
     *
     * <p><b>Warning:</b> Do NOT make any calls to {@link IBackupTransport} or call any variants of
     * {@link TransportClient#connect(String)} here, otherwise you risk deadlock.
