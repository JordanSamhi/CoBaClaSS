     * Retrieves the text from the last UI traversal event received.
     *
     * You can use this method to read the contents in a WebView container
     * because the accessibility framework fires events
     * as each text is highlighted. You can write a test to perform
     * directional arrow presses to focus on different elements inside a WebView,
     * and call this method to get the text from each traversed element.
     * If you are testing a view container that can return a reference to a
     * Document Object Model (DOM) object, your test should use the view's
     * DOM instead.
     *
     * @return text of the last traversal event, else return an empty string
