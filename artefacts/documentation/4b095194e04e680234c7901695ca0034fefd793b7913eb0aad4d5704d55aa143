     * Sends a message to the specified destination. Aware messages are transmitted in the context
     * of a discovery session - executed subsequent to a publish/subscribe
     * {@link DiscoverySessionCallback#onServiceDiscovered(PeerHandle,
     * byte[], java.util.List)} event.
     * <p>
     *     Aware messages are not guaranteed delivery. Callbacks on
     *     {@link DiscoverySessionCallback} indicate message was transmitted successfully,
     *     {@link DiscoverySessionCallback#onMessageSendSucceeded(int)}, or transmission
     *     failed (possibly after several retries) -
     *     {@link DiscoverySessionCallback#onMessageSendFailed(int)}.
     * <p>
     *     The peer will get a callback indicating a message was received using
     *     {@link DiscoverySessionCallback#onMessageReceived(PeerHandle,
     *     byte[])}.
     *
     * @param peerHandle The peer's handle for the message. Must be a result of an
     * {@link DiscoverySessionCallback#onServiceDiscovered(PeerHandle,
     * byte[], java.util.List)} or
     * {@link DiscoverySessionCallback#onMessageReceived(PeerHandle,
     * byte[])} events.
     * @param messageId An arbitrary integer used by the caller to identify the message. The same
     *            integer ID will be returned in the callbacks indicating message send success or
     *            failure. The {@code messageId} is not used internally by the Aware service - it
     *                  can be arbitrary and non-unique.
     * @param message The message to be transmitted.
     * @param retryCount An integer specifying how many additional service-level (as opposed to PHY
     *            or MAC level) retries should be attempted if there is no ACK from the receiver
     *            (note: no retransmissions are attempted in other failure cases). A value of 0
     *            indicates no retries. Max permitted value is {@link #getMaxSendRetryCount()}.
