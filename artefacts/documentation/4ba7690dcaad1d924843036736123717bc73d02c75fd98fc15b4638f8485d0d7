     * Creates and returns an initialized, internal service for use by other components.
     * <p>
     * The object returned is identical to the one returned by the LocalServices class using:
     * {@code LocalServices.getService(PermissionManagerServiceInternal.class);}
     * <p>
     * NOTE: The external lock is temporary and should be removed. This needs to be a
     * lock created by the permission manager itself.
