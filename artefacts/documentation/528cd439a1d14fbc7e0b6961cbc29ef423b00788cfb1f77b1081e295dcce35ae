     * Looks for a time zone using only information present in the supplied {@link NitzData} object.
     *
     * <p><em>Note:</em> Because multiple time zones can have the same offset / DST state at a given
     * time this process is error prone; an arbitrary match is returned when there are multiple
     * candidates. The algorithm can also return a non-exact match by assuming that the DST
     * information provided by NITZ is incorrect. This method can return {@code null} if no matching
     * time zones are found.
