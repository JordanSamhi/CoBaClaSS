     * Specify a list of X.509 certificates that identifies the server. The validation
     * passes if the CA of server certificate matches one of the given certificates.

     * <p>Default names are automatically assigned to the certificates and used
     * with this configuration. The framework takes care of installing the
     * certificates when the config is saved and removing the certificates when
     * the config is removed.
     *
     * Note: If no certificates are set for an Enterprise configuration, either by not calling this
     * API (or the {@link #setCaCertificate(X509Certificate)}, or by calling it with null, then the
     * server certificate validation is skipped - which means that the
     * connection is not secure.
     *
     * @param certs X.509 CA certificates
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if any of the provided certificates is
     *     not a CA certificate
