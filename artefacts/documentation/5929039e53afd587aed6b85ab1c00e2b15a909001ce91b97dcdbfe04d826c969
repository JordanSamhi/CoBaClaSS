     * Wrapper around {@link BitmapFactory#decodeStream(InputStream, Rect,
     * BitmapFactory.Options)} that returns {@code null} on {@link
     * OutOfMemoryError}.
     *
     * @param factory    Used to create input streams that holds the raw data to be decoded into a
     *                   bitmap.
     * @param outPadding If not null, return the padding rect for the bitmap if
     *                   it exists, otherwise set padding to [-1,-1,-1,-1]. If
     *                   no bitmap is returned (null) then padding is
     *                   unchanged.
     * @param opts       null-ok; Options that control downsampling and whether the
     *                   image should be completely decoded, or just is size returned.
     * @return The decoded bitmap, or null if the image data could not be
     * decoded, or, if opts is non-null, if opts requested only the
     * size be returned (in opts.outWidth and opts.outHeight)
