     * If a ScanData indicates that the bucket the settings were placed in was scanned then it
     * will always be included (filtered to only include requested channels). If it indicates that
     * the bucket was definitely not scanned then the scan data will not be reported.
     * If it is not possible to determine if the settings bucket was scanned or not then a
     * ScanData will be included if the scan was empty or there was at least one scan result that
     * matches a requested channel (again the results will be filtered to only include requested
     * channels.
