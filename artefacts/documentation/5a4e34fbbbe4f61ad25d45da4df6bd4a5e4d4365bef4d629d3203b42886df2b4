     * Returns the amount by which the {@param d} should be scaled (in both dimensions) so that it
     * matches the design guidelines for a launcher icon.
     *
     * We first calculate the convex hull of the visible portion of the icon.
     * This hull then compared with the bounding rectangle of the hull to find how closely it
     * resembles a circle and a square, by comparing the ratio of the areas. Note that this is not an
     * ideal solution but it gives satisfactory result without affecting the performance.
     *
     * This closeness is used to determine the ratio of hull area to the full icon size.
     * Refer {@link #MAX_CIRCLE_AREA_FACTOR} and {@link #MAX_SQUARE_AREA_FACTOR}
     *
     * @param outBounds optional rect to receive the fraction distance from each edge.
