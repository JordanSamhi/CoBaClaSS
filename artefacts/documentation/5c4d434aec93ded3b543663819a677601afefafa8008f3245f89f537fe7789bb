         * We received a callback from ImsCallSession that merge completed.
         * @param newSession - this session can have 2 values based on the below scenarios
         *
	 * Conference Scenarios :
         * Case 1 - 3 way success case
         * Case 2 - 3 way success case but held call fails to merge
         * Case 3 - 3 way success case but active call fails to merge
         * case 4 - 4 way success case, where merge is initiated on the foreground single-party
         *          call and the conference (mergeHost) is the background call.
         * case 5 - 4 way success case, where merge is initiated on the foreground conference
         *          call (mergeHost) and the single party call is in the background.
         *
         * Conference Result:
         * session : new session after conference
         * newSession = new session for case 1, 2, 3.
         *              Should be considered as mTransientConferencession
         * newSession = Active conference session for case 5 will be null
         *              mergehost was foreground call
         *              mTransientConferencession will be null
         * newSession = Active conference session for case 4 will be null
         *              mergeHost was background call
         *              mTransientConferencession will be null
