     * Generate shadow vertices based on params. Format : (x1,y1,z1,x2,y2,z2 ...)
     * Precondition : Light poly must be evenly distributed on a flat surface
     * Precondition : Poly vertices must be a convex
     * Precondition : Light height must be higher than any poly vertices
     *
     * @param lightPoly - Vertices of a light source.
     * @param poly - Vertices of opaque object casting shadow
     * @param polyLength - Size of the vertices
     * @param strength - Strength of the shadow overall [0-1]
     * @param retstrips - Arrays of triplets, each triplet represents a point, thus every array to
     * be filled in format : {x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2, ...},
     * every 3 consecutive triplets constitute a triangle to fill, namely [t1, t2, t3], [t2, t3,
     * t4], ... If at some point [t(n-1), tn, t(n+1)] is no longer a desired a triangle and
     * there are more triangles to draw one can start a new array, hence retstrips is a 2D array.
