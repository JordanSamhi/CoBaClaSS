     * @return The error status of the response of an APDU command. An error status can be any
     *         positive 16-bit integer (i.e., SW1 & SW2) other than
     *         {@link ApduSender#STATUS_NO_ERROR} which means no error. For an error encountered
     *         when opening a logical channel before the APDU command gets sent, this is not the
     *         status defined in {@link IccOpenLogicalChannelResponse}. In this caes, 0 will be
     *         returned and the message of this exception will have the detailed error information.
