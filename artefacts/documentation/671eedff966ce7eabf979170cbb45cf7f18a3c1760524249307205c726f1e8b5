     * device owner or profile owner. When other apps attempt to save a {@link WifiConfiguration}
     * with modified proxy settings, the methods {@link WifiManager#addNetwork} and
     * {@link WifiManager#updateNetwork} fail and return {@code -1}.

     * @param httpProxy {@link ProxyInfo} representing the httpProxy to be used by this
     *                  WifiConfiguration. Setting this to {@code null} will explicitly set no
     *                  proxy, removing any proxy that was previously set.
