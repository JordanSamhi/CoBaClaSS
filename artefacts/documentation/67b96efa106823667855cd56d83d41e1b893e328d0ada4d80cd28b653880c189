     * The caller must use {@link #applySurfaceChanges} to apply the new layout to the surface.
     * @param outer the outer frame of the letterbox (this frame will be black, except the area
     *              that intersects with the {code inner} frame), in global coordinates
     * @param inner the inner frame of the letterbox (this frame will be clear), in global
     *              coordinates
     * @param surfaceOrigin the origin of the surface factory in global coordinates
