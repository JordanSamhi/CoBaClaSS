     * Stop tracking candidate tethering upstreams and release mobile network request.
     * Note: this function is used when tethering is stopped because tethering do not need to
     * choose upstream anymore. But it would not stop default network tracking because
     * EntitlementManager may need to know default network to decide whether to request entitlement
     * check even tethering is not active yet.
