         * Set the resize value when using a {@link android.graphics.Bitmap} as the source.
         * If the bitmap's area is greater than the value specified, then the bitmap
         * will be resized so that its area matches {@code area}. If the
         * bitmap is smaller or equal, the original is used as-is.
         * <p>
         * This value has a large effect on the processing time. The larger the resized image is,
         * the greater time it will take to generate the palette. The smaller the image is, the
         * more detail is lost in the resulting image and thus less precision for color selection.
         *
         * @param area the number of pixels that the intermediary scaled down Bitmap should cover,
         *             or any value <= 0 to disable resizing.
