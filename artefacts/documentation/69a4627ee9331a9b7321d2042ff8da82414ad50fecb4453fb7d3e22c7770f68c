         * Called immediately after a controller is connected. This is a convenient method to add
         * custom initialization between the session and a controller.
         * <p>
         * Note that calls to the controller (e.g. {@link #sendSessionCommand}) work here but don't
         * work in {@link #onConnect} because the controller hasn't connected yet in
         * {@link #onConnect}.
         *
         * @param session the session for this event
         * @param controller controller information.
