     * <em>IMPORTANT:</em> Not all packages returned by this method may be known
     * to the system. There are two conditions in which this may occur:
     * <ol>
     *   <li>The package is on adoptable storage and the device has been removed</li>
     *   <li>The package is being removed and the internal structures are partially updated</li>
     * </ol>
     * The second is an artifact of the current data structures and should be fixed. See
     * b/111075456 for one such instance.
