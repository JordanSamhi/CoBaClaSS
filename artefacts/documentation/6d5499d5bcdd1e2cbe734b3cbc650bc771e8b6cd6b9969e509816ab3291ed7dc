     * Sort a list of ApnSetting objects, with the preferred APNs at the front of the list
     *
     * e.g. if the preferred APN set = 2 and we have
     *   1. APN with apn_set_id = 0 = Carriers.NO_SET_SET (no set is set)
     *   2. APN with apn_set_id = 1 (not preferred set)
     *   3. APN with apn_set_id = 2 (preferred set)
     * Then the return order should be (3, 1, 2) or (3, 2, 1)
     *
     * e.g. if the preferred APN set = Carriers.NO_SET_SET (no preferred set) then the
     * return order can be anything
