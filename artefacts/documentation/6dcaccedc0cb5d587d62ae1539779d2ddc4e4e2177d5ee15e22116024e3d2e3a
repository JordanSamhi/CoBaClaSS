         * Called when a new default network is connected.
         *
         * <p>The Ikev2VpnRunner will unconditionally switch to the new network, killing the old IKE
         * state in the process, and starting a new IkeSession instance.
         *
         * <p>This method is called multiple times over the lifetime of the Ikev2VpnRunner, and is
         * called on the ConnectivityService thread. Thus, the actual work MUST be proxied to the
         * mExecutor thread in order to ensure consistency of the Ikev2VpnRunner fields.
