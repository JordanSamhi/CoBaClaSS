     * Inflate a new hierarchy from the specified xml node. Throws
     * InflaterException if there is an error. *
     * <p>
     * <em><strong>Important</strong></em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For performance
     * reasons, inflation relies heavily on pre-processing of XML files
     * that is done at build time. Therefore, it is not currently possible to
     * use inflater with an XmlPullParser over a plain XML file at runtime.
     * 
     * @param parser XML dom node containing the description of the
     *        hierarchy.
     * @param root Optional parent of the generated hierarchy.
     * @return The root of the inflated hierarchy. If root was supplied,
     *         this is the that; otherwise it is the root of the inflated
     *         XML file.
