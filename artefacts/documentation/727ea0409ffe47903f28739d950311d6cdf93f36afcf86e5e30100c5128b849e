     * thread.
     *
     * <p>If the current thread has not been added to the Watchdog, this call is a no-op.
     *
     * <p>If the Watchdog action for the current thread is already resumed, this call logs a wtf.
     *
     * <p>If all pauses have been resumed, the Watchdog action is finally resumed, otherwise,
     * the Watchdog action for the current thread remains paused until resume is called at least
     * as many times as the calls to pause.
