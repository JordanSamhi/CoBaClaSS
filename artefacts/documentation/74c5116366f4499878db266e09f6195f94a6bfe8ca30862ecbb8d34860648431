     * WindowManager remains the source of truth of the touch mode state.
     * However, we need to keep a copy of this state in input.
     *
     * The apps determine the touch mode state. Therefore, a single app will
     * affect the global state. That state change needs to be propagated to
     * other apps, when they become focused.
     *
     * When input dispatches focus to the apps, the touch mode state
     * will be sent together with the focus change.

     * @param inTouchMode true if the device is in touch mode.
