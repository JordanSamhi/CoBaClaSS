     * Start listening to tethering change events. Any new added callback will receive the last
     * tethering status right away. If callback is registered,
     * {@link TetheringEventCallback#onUpstreamChanged} will immediately be called. If tethering
     * has no upstream or disabled, the argument of callback will be null. The same callback object
     * cannot be registered twice.
     *
     * @param executor the executor on which callback will be invoked.
     * @param callback the callback to be called when tethering has change events.
