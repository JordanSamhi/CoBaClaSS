     * Causes words in the text that are longer than the view's width
     * to be ellipsized instead of broken in the middle.  You may also
     * want to {@link #setSingleLine} or {@link #setHorizontallyScrolling}
     * to constrain the text to a single line.  Use <code>null</code>
     * to turn off ellipsizing.
     *
     * If {@link #setMaxLines} has been used to set two or more lines,
     * only {@link android.text.TextUtils.TruncateAt#END} and
     * {@link android.text.TextUtils.TruncateAt#MARQUEE} are supported
     * (other ellipsizing types will not do anything).
