     * Gets the shortcut intent for a given keycode+modifier. Make sure you
     * strip whatever modifier is used for invoking shortcuts (for example,
     * if 'Sym+A' should invoke a shortcut on 'A', you should strip the
     * 'Sym' bit from the modifiers before calling this method.
     * <p>
     * This will first try an exact match (with modifiers), and then try a
     * match without modifiers (primary character on a key).
     * 
     * @param kcm The key character map of the device on which the key was pressed.

     * @param metaState The meta state, omitting any modifiers that were used
     * to invoke the shortcut.
     * @return The intent that matches the shortcut, or null if not found.
