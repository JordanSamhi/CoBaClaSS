     * Set the menu item as disabled by admin by adding a restricted padlock at the end of the
     * text and set the click listener which will send an intent to show the admin support details
     * dialog. If the admin is null, remove the padlock and disabled color span. When the admin is
     * null, we also set the OnMenuItemClickListener to null, so if you want to set a custom
     * OnMenuItemClickListener, set it after calling this method.
