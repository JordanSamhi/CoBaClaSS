     * <p>Synchronous version of {@link #connectAsync(TransportConnectionListener, String)}. The
     * same observations about state are valid here. Also, what was said about the {@link
     * IBackupTransport} parameter of {@link TransportConnectionListener} now apply to the return
     * value of this method.
     *
     * <p>This is a potentially blocking operation, so be sure to call this carefully on the correct
     * threads. You can't call this from the process main-thread (it throws an exception if you do
     * so).
     *
     * <p>In most cases only the first call to this method will block, the following calls should
     * return instantly. However, this is not guaranteed.
     *
     * @param caller A {@link String} identifying the caller for logging/debugging purposes. Check
     *     {@link #connectAsync(TransportConnectionListener, String)} for more details.
     * @return A {@link IBackupTransport} transport binder instance or null. If it's non-null it can
     *     still be unusable - throws {@link DeadObjectException} on method calls
