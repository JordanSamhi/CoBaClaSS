     * A timestamp of SystemClock.uptimeMillis() of when this entry was first created, regardless
     * of any changes to the data presented. It is set once on creation and will never change, and
     * allows us to know exactly how long this notification has been alive for in our listener
     * service. It is entirely unrelated to the information inside of the notification.
     *
     * This is different to Notification#when because it persists throughout updates, whereas
     * system server treats every single call to notify() as a new notification and we handle
     * updates to NotificationEntry locally.
