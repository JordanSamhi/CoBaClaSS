     * setSarScenarioNeeded()
     * Returns true if a call towards HAL to set SAR scenario to that value would be
     * necessary. This happens in the following cases:
     *   1. All Wifi modes were disabled, hence we need to init the SAR scenario value.
     *   2. The new scenario is different from the last reported one.
     *
     * Returns false if the last call to HAL was to set the scenario to that value, hence,
     * another call to set the SAR scenario to the same value would be redundant.
