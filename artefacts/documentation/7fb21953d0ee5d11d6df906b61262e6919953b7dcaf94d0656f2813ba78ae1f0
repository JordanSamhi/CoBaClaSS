     * <p>The caller is still responsible for managing any resources used by the adapter.
     * Notably, when the AutoCompleteTextView is closed or released, the adapter is not notified.
     * A common case is the use of {@link android.widget.CursorAdapter}, which
     * contains a {@link android.database.Cursor} that must be closed.  This can be done
     * automatically (see
     * {@link android.app.Activity#startManagingCursor(android.database.Cursor)
     * startManagingCursor()}),
     * or by manually closing the cursor when the AutoCompleteTextView is dismissed.</p>
