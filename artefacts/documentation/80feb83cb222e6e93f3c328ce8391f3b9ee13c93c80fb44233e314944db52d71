         * The method takes an optional tag to associate with the setting
         * which can be used to clear only settings made by your package and
         * associated with this tag by passing the tag to {@link
         * #resetToDefaults(ContentResolver, String)}. Anyone can override
         * the current tag. Also if another package changes the setting
         * then the tag will be set to the one specified in the set call
         * which can be null. Also any of the settings setters that do not
         * take a tag as an argument effectively clears the tag.
         * </p><p>
         * For example, if you set settings A and B with tags T1 and T2 and
         * another app changes setting A (potentially to the same value), it
         * can assign to it a tag T3 (note that now the package that changed
         * the setting is not yours). Now if you reset your changes for T1 and
         * T2 only setting B will be reset and A not (as it was changed by
         * another package) but since A did not change you are in the desired
         * initial state. Now if the other app changes the value of A (assuming
         * you registered an observer in the beginning) you would detect that
         * the setting was changed by another app and handle this appropriately
         * (ignore, set back to some value, etc).
         * </p><p>
         * Also the method takes an argument whether to make the value the
         * default for this setting. If the system already specified a default
         * value, then the one passed in here will <strong>not</strong>
         * be set as the default.
