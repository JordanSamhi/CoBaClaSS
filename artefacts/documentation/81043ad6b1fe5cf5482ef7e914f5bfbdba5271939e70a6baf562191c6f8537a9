         * Locks the Wi-Fi radio on until {@link #release} is called.
         *
         * If this WifiLock is reference-counted, each call to {@code acquire} will increment the
         * reference count, and the radio will remain locked as long as the reference count is
         * above zero.
         *
         * If this WifiLock is not reference-counted, the first call to {@code acquire} will lock
         * the radio, but subsequent calls will be ignored.  Only one call to {@link #release}
         * will be required, regardless of the number of times that {@code acquire} is called.
