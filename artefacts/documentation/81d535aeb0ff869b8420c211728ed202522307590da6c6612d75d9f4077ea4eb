     * Finds a view that was identified by the {@code android:id} XML attribute
     * that was processed in {@link android.app.Activity#onCreate}, or throws an
     * IllegalArgumentException if the ID is invalid, or there is no matching view in the hierarchy.
     * <p>
     * <strong>Note:</strong> In most cases -- depending on compiler support --
     * the resulting view is automatically cast to the target class type. If
     * the target class type is unconstrained, an explicit cast may be
     * necessary.
