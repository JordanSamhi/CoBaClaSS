     * Initiate peer discovery. A discovery process involves scanning for available Wi-Fi peers
     * for the purpose of establishing a connection.
     *
     * <p> The function call immediately returns after sending a discovery request
     * to the framework. The application is notified of a success or failure to initiate
     * discovery through listener callbacks {@link ActionListener#onSuccess} or
     * {@link ActionListener#onFailure}.
     *
     * <p> The discovery remains active until a connection is initiated or
     * a p2p group is formed. Register for {@link #WIFI_P2P_PEERS_CHANGED_ACTION} intent to
     * determine when the framework notifies of a change as peers are discovered.
     *
     * <p> Upon receiving a {@link #WIFI_P2P_PEERS_CHANGED_ACTION} intent, an application
     * can request for the list of peers using {@link #requestPeers}.
     *
     * @param c is the channel created at {@link #initialize}
     * @param listener for callbacks on success or failure. Can be null.
