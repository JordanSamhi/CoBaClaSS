   * Set a view to be resized when the keyboard is shown. This will set the bottom margin of the
   * view to be immediately above the keyboard, and assumes that the view sits immediately above the
   * navigation bar.
   *
   * <p>Note that you must set {@link android.R.attr#windowSoftInputMode} to {@code adjustResize}
   * for this class to work. Otherwise window insets are not dispatched and this method will have no
   * effect.
   *
   * <p>This will only take effect in versions Lollipop or above. Otherwise this is a no-op.
   *
   * @param view The view to be resized when the keyboard is shown.
