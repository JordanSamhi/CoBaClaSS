     * Returns the total offset to apply to the {@link #getCurrentTimeInMillis()} to arrive at a
     * local time. NITZ is limited in only being able to express total offsets in multiples of 15
     * minutes.
     *
     * <p>Note that some time zones change offset during the year for reasons other than "daylight
     * savings", e.g. for Ramadan. This is not well handled by most date / time APIs.
