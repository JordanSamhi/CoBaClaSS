     * Get the Activity under test, starting it if necessary.
     *
     * For each test method invocation, the Activity will not actually be created until the first
     * time this method is called.
     *
     * <p>If you wish to provide custom setup values to your Activity, you may call
     * {@link #setActivityIntent(Intent)} and/or {@link #setActivityInitialTouchMode(boolean)}
     * before your first call to getActivity().  Calling them after your Activity has
     * started will have no effect.
     *
     * <p><b>NOTE:</b> Activities under test may not be started from within the UI thread.
     * If your test method is annotated with {@link android.test.UiThreadTest}, then your Activity
     * will be started automatically just before your test method is run.  You still call this
     * method in order to get the Activity under test.
     *
     * @return the Activity under test
