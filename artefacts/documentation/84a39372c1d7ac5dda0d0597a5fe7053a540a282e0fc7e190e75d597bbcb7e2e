     * Builds an entire list (suitable for display) of
     * activities that are searchable, by iterating the entire set of
     * ACTION_SEARCH & ACTION_WEB_SEARCH intents.
     *
     * Also clears the hash of all activities -> searches which will
     * refill as the user clicks "search".
     *
     * This should only be done at startup and again if we know that the
     * list has changed.
     *
     * TODO: every activity that provides a ACTION_SEARCH intent should
     * also provide searchability meta-data.  There are a bunch of checks here
     * that, if data is not found, silently skip to the next activity.  This
     * won't help a developer trying to figure out why their activity isn't
     * showing up in the list, but an exception here is too rough.  I would
     * like to find a better notification mechanism.
     *
     * TODO: sort the list somehow?  UI choice.
