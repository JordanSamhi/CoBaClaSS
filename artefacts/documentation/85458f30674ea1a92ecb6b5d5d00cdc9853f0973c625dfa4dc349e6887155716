     * Prepares the scene for action.
     * <p>
     * This call is blocking if another rendering/inflating is currently happening, and will return
     * whether the preparation worked.
     *
     * The preparation can fail if another rendering took too long and the timeout was elapsed.
     *
     * More than one call to this from the same thread will have no effect and will return
     * {@link Result.Status#SUCCESS}.
     *
     * After scene actions have taken place, only one call to {@link #release()} must be
     * done.
     *
     * @param timeout the time to wait if another rendering is happening.
     *
     * @return whether the scene was prepared
     *
     * @see #release()
     *
     * @throws IllegalStateException if {@link #init(long)} was never called.
