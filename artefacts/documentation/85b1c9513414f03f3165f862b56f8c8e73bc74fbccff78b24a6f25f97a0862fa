     * Public methods in the UiAutomator should call this function to generate a
     * trace. The trace will include the method thats is being called, it's
     * arguments and where in the user's code the method is called from. If a
     * public method is called internally from UIAutomator then this will not
     * output a trace entry. Only calls from outise the UiAutomator package will
     * produce output.
     *
     * Special note about array arguments. You can safely pass arrays of reference types
     * to this function. Like String[] or Integer[]. The trace function will print their
     * contents by calling toString() on each of the elements. This will not work for
     * array of primitive types like int[] or float[]. Before passing them to this function
     * convert them to arrays of reference types manually. Example: convert int[] to Integer[].
     *
     * @param arguments arguments of the method being traced.
