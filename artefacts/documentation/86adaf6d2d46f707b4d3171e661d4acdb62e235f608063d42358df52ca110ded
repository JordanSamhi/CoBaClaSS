     *
     * If compression is enabled, the layout hierarchy derived from the Acessibility
     * framework will only contain nodes that are important for uiautomator
     * testing. Any unnecessary surrounding layout nodes that make viewing
     * and searching the hierarchy inefficient are removed.
     *
     * @param compressed true to enable compression; else, false to disable
