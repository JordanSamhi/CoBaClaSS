     * Tracks a collection that is at risk of leaking large objects, e.g. a collection of
     * dynamically registered listeners.
     *
     * The LeakDetector will monitor and keep weak references to such collections, dump
     * statistics about them in a bugreport, and in the future dump the heap if their size starts
     * growing unreasonably.
     *
     * This should be called whenever the collection grows.
     *
     * @param tag A tag for labeling the collection in a bugreport
