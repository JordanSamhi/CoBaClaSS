     * Attempt to tether the named interface.  This will setup a dhcp server
     * on the interface, forward and NAT IP v4 packets and forward DNS requests
     * to the best active upstream network interface.  Note that if no upstream
     * IP network interface is available, dhcp will still run and traffic will be
     * allowed between the tethered devices and this device, though upstream net
     * access will of course fail until an upstream network interface becomes
     * active.

     * and will migrate away as soon as possible.
