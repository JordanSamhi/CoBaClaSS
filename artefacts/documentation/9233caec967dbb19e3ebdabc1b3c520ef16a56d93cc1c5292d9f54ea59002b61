     * If you're here because you're not receiving touch events on a view that is a descendant of
     * BubbleStackView, and you think BSV is intercepting them - it's not! You need to subtract the
     * bounds of the view in question in {@link #subtractObscuredTouchableRegion}. The ActivityView
     * consumes all touch events within its bounds, even for views like the BubbleStackView that are
     * above it. It ignores typical view touch handling methods like this one and
     * dispatchTouchEvent.
