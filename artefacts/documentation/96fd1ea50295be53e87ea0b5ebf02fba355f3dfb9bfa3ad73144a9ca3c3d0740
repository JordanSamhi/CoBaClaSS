     * Set loading state for {@link BarChartPreference}.
     *
     * By default, {@link BarChartPreference} doesn't care about it.
     *
     * But if user sets loading state to true explicitly, it means {@link BarChartPreference}
     * needs to take some time to load data. So we won't initialize any view now.
     *
     * Once the state is updated to false, we will start to initialize view again.
     *
     * @param isLoading whether or not {@link BarChartPreference} is in loading state.
