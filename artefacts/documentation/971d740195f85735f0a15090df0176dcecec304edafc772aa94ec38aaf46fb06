     * Reads 2 bytes in *little endian format* from the stream and composes a 16-bit integer.
     * As we are storing the 2-byte value in a 4-byte integer, the upper 2 bytes are always
     * 0, essentially making the returned value *unsigned*.
     * @return The 16-bit integer (packed into the lower 2 bytes of an int) encoded by the
     * next 2 bytes in the stream.
     * @throws IndexOutOfBoundsException
