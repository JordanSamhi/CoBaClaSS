     * Convert a network prefix length to an IPv4 netmask integer (prefixLength 17 -> 0x0080ffff).
     *
     * <p>This method stores the higher-order IPv4 address bytes in the lower-order int bytes,
     * which is an unusual convention. Consider {@link #prefixLengthToV4NetmaskIntHTH(int)} instead.
     * @return the IPv4 netmask as an integer
