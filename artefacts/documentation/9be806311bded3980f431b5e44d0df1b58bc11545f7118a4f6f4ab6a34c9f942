     * Returns the offset (already included in {@link #getLocalOffsetMillis()}) associated with
     * Daylight Savings Time (DST). This field is optional: {@code null} means the DST offset is
     * unknown. NITZ is limited in only being able to express DST offsets in positive multiples of
     * one or two hours.
     *
     * <p>Callers should remember that standard time / DST is a matter of convention: it has
     * historically been assumed by NITZ and many date/time APIs that DST happens in the summer and
     * the "raw" offset will increase during this time, usually by one hour. However, the tzdb
     * maintainers have moved to different conventions on a country-by-country basis so that some
     * summer times are considered the "standard" time (i.e. in this model winter time is the "DST"
     * and a negative adjustment, usually of (negative) one hour.
     *
     * <p>There is nothing that says NITZ and tzdb need to treat DST conventions the same.
     *
     * <p>At the time of writing Android date/time APIs are sticking with the historic tzdb
     * convention that DST is used in summer time and is <em>always</em> a positive offset but this
     * could change in future. If Android or carriers change the conventions used then it might make
     * NITZ comparisons with tzdb information more error-prone.
     *
     * <p>See also {@link #getLocalOffsetMillis()} for other reasons besides DST that a local offset
     * may change.
