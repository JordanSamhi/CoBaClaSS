     * that was processed in {@link #onCreate}.
     * <p>
     * <strong>Note:</strong> In most cases -- depending on compiler support --
     * the resulting view is automatically cast to the target class type. If
     * the target class type is unconstrained, an explicit cast may be
     * necessary.

     * @param id the ID to search for
     * @return a view with given ID if found, or {@code null} otherwise
