     * Iterate over the set of all jobs, invoking the supplied functor on each.  This is for
     * customers who need to examine each job; we'd much rather not have to generate
     * transient unified collections for them to iterate over and then discard, or creating
     * iterators every time a client needs to perform a sweep.
