     * Converts the string into a json object to retreive the nodes. The Json should have 3 nodes,
     * including the Carrier public key, the key type and the key identifier. Once the nodes have
     * been extracted, they get persisted to the database. Sample:
     *      "carrier-keys": [ { "certificate": "",
     *                         "key-type": "WLAN",
     *                         "key-identifier": ""
     *                        } ]
     * @param jsonStr the json string.
     * @param mccMnc contains the mcc, mnc.
