     * Finds the first descendant view with the given ID or {@code null} if the
     * ID is invalid (< 0), there is no matching view in the hierarchy, or the
     * dialog has not yet been fully created (for example, via {@link #show()}
     * or {@link #create()}).
     * <p>
     * <strong>Note:</strong> In most cases -- depending on compiler support --
     * the resulting view is automatically cast to the target class type. If
     * the target class type is unconstrained, an explicit cast may be
     * necessary.
