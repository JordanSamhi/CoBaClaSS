     * Given a combination of MCC and MNC, returns a lower case ISO 3166 alpha-2 country code for
     * the device's geographical location.
     *
     * <p>This can give a better geographical result than {@link #countryCodeForMcc(String)}
     * (which provides the official "which country is the MCC assigned to?" answer) for cases when
     * MNC is also available: Sometimes an MCC can be used by multiple countries and the MNC can
     * help distinguish, or the MCC assigned to a country isn't used for geopolitical reasons.
     * When the geographical country is needed  (e.g. time zone detection) this version can provide
     * more pragmatic results than the official MCC-only answer. This method falls back to calling
     * {@link #countryCodeForMcc(int)} if no special MCC+MNC cases are found.
     * Returns empty string if no code can be determined.
