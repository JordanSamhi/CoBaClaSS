     * This method returns the drawing rect for the view which is different from the regular
     * drawing rect, since we layout all children in the {@link NotificationStackScrollLayout} at
     * position 0 and usually the translation is neglected. The standard implementation doesn't
     * account for translation.
     *
     * @param outRect The (scrolled) drawing bounds of the view.
