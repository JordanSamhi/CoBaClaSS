 start wifi scan in background
     * @param settings specifies various parameters for the scan; for more information look at
     * {@link ScanSettings}
     * @param workSource WorkSource to blame for power usage
     * @param listener specifies the object to report events to. This object is also treated as a
     *                 key for this scan, and must also be specified to cancel the scan. Multiple
     *                 scans should also not share this object.
     * @deprecated Background scan support has always been hardware vendor dependent. This support
     * may not be present on newer devices. Use {@link #startScan(ScanSettings, ScanListener)}
     * instead for single scans.
