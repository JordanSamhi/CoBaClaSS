         * Dispatches volume key events. This is called when the foreground activity didn't handle
         * the incoming volume key event.
         * <p>
         * Handles the dispatching of the volume button events to one of the
         * registered listeners. If there's a volume key long-press listener and
         * there's no active global priority session, long-presses will be sent to the
         * long-press listener instead of adjusting volume.

         * @param packageName The caller's package name, obtained by Context#getPackageName()
         * @param opPackageName The caller's op package name, obtained by Context#getOpPackageName()
         * @param asSystemService {@code true} if the event sent to the session as if it was come
         *          from the system service instead of the app process. This helps sessions to
         *          distinguish between the key injection by the app and key events from the
         *          hardware devices. Should be used only when the volume key events aren't handled
         *          by foreground activity. {@code false} otherwise to tell session about the real
         *          caller.
         * @param keyEvent a non-null KeyEvent whose key code is one of the
         *            {@link KeyEvent#KEYCODE_VOLUME_UP},
         *            {@link KeyEvent#KEYCODE_VOLUME_DOWN},
         *            or {@link KeyEvent#KEYCODE_VOLUME_MUTE}.
         * @param stream stream type to adjust volume.
         * @param musicOnly true if both UI and haptic feedback aren't needed when adjusting volume.
