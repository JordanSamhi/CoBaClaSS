         * Create a {@link Policy} instance based on the current configuration. This
         * method checks for certain policy invariants used to enforce certain guarantees
         * about the expected structure of a policy stanza.
         * Those invariants are:
         * </p>
         * <ul>
         *   <li> at least one cert must be found </li>
         *   <li> either a global seinfo value is present OR at least one
         *     inner package mapping must be present BUT not both. </li>
         * </ul>
         * @return an instance of {@link Policy} with the options set from this builder
         * @throws IllegalStateException if an invariant is violated.
