    * <h3>4.1 Content Lines</h3>
    *
    * <p>The iCalendar object is organized into individual lines of text, called
    * content lines. Content lines are delimited by a line break, which is a CRLF
    * sequence (US-ASCII decimal 13, followed by US-ASCII decimal 10).
    *
    * <p>Lines of text SHOULD NOT be longer than 75 octets, excluding the line
    * break. Long content lines SHOULD be split into a multiple line
    * representations using a line "folding" technique. That is, a long line can
    * be split between any two characters by inserting a CRLF immediately
    * followed by a single linear white space character (i.e., SPACE, US-ASCII
    * decimal 32 or HTAB, US-ASCII decimal 9). Any sequence of CRLF followed
    * immediately by a single linear white space character is ignored (i.e.,
    * removed) when processing the content type.
