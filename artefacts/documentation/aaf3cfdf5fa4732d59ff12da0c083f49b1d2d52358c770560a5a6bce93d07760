     * Attempt to get byte at the requested index from the wrapped input stream. If the internal
     * buffer contains the requested index, return immediately. If the index is less than the
     * head of the buffer, or the index is greater or equal to the size of the wrapped input stream,
     * a runtime exception is thrown.
     *
     * <p/>
     * If the index is not in the internal buffer, but it can be requested from the input stream,
     * {@link #fill(int)} will be called first, and the byte at the index returned.
     *
     * <p/>
     * You should always call {@link #has(int)} with the same index, unless you are sure that no
     * exceptions will be thrown as described above.
     *
     * <p/>
     * Consider calling {@link #advanceTo(int)} if you know that you will never request a lesser
     * index in the future.
     * @param index The requested index.
     * @return The byte at that index.
