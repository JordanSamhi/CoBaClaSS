     * Points are expressed in terms of their relative position on the perimeter of the display,
     * moving counter-clockwise. This method converts a point to clockwise, assisting use cases
     * such as animating to a point clockwise instead of counter-clockwise.
     *
     * @param point A point in the range from 0 to 1.
     * @return A point in the range of -1 to 0 that represents the same location as {@code point}.
