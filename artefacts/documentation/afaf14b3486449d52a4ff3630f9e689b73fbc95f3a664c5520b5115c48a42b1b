     * Sets a matrix such that given a two rotations, that it transforms coordinates given in the
     * old rotation to coordinates that refer to the same physical location in the new rotation.
     *
     * @param oldRotation the rotation to transform from
     * @param newRotation the rotation to transform to
     * @param newWidth the width of the area to transform, in the new rotation
     * @param newHeight the height of the area to transform, in the new rotation
     * @param out a matrix that will be set to the transform
