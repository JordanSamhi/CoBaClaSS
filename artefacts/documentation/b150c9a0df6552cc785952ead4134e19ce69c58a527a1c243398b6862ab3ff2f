     * Get the LayoutParams associated with this view. All views should have
     * layout parameters. These supply parameters to the <i>parent</i> of this
     * view specifying how it should be arranged. There are many subclasses of
     * ViewGroup.LayoutParams, and these correspond to the different subclasses
     * of ViewGroup that are responsible for arranging their children.
     *
     * This method may return null if this View is not attached to a parent
     * ViewGroup or {@link #setLayoutParams(android.view.ViewGroup.LayoutParams)}
     * was not invoked successfully. When a View is attached to a parent
     * ViewGroup, this method must not return null.
     *
     * @return The LayoutParams associated with this view, or null if no
     *         parameters have been set yet
