         * Set the BSSID match pattern to use for filtering networks from scan results.
         * Will match all networks with BSSID which satisfies the following:
         * {@code BSSID & mask == baseAddress}.
         * <p>
         * <li>Overrides any previous value set using {@link #setBssid(MacAddress)} or
         * {@link #setBssidPattern(MacAddress, MacAddress)}.</li>
         *
         * @param baseAddress Base address for BSSID pattern.
         * @param mask Mask for BSSID pattern.
         * @return Instance of {@link Builder} to enable chaining of the builder method.
