     * Initializing a new Authentication token, possibly from an existing credential and hash.
     *
     * The authentication token would bear a randomly-generated synthetic password.
     *
     * This method has the side effect of rebinding the SID of the given user to the
     * newly-generated SP.
     *
     * If the existing credential hash is non-null, the existing SID mill be migrated so
     * the synthetic password in the authentication token will produce the same SID
     * (the corresponding synthetic password handle is persisted by SyntheticPasswordManager
     * in a per-user data storage.)
     *
     * If the existing credential hash is null, it means the given user should have no SID so
     * SyntheticPasswordManager will nuke any SP handle previously persisted. In this case,
     * the supplied credential parameter is also ignored.
     *
     * Also saves the escrow information necessary to re-generate the synthetic password under
     * an escrow scheme. This information can be removed with {@link #destroyEscrowData} if
     * password escrow should be disabled completely on the given user.
