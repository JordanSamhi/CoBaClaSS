     * Open a connection to a camera with the given ID, on behalf of another application
     * specified by clientUid.

     * <p>The behavior of this method matches that of {@link #openCamera}, except that it allows
     * the caller to specify the UID to use for permission/etc verification. This can only be
     * done by services trusted by the camera subsystem to act on behalf of applications and
     * to forward the real UID.</p>
     *
     * @param clientUid
     *             The UID of the application on whose behalf the camera is being opened.
     *             Must be USE_CALLING_UID unless the caller is a trusted service.
