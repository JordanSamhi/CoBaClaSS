     * Declare a key to be expected in the future. The order in which you expect keys is very
     * important. Keys that are declared first are guaranteed to have their tasks run first. You
     * must call either {@link #forget(Object)} or {@link #execute(Object, Runnable)}
     * with this key in the future, or you will leak the key.
     *
     * If you call expect with a previously expected key, the key will be placed at the back of
     * the expected queue and its callback will be replaced with this one.
     *
     * @param key      the key to expect a task for. Use the same key when setting the task later
     *                 with {@link #execute (Object, Runnable)}.
     * @param callback the callback to notify when the key becomes the first expected key, or null.
