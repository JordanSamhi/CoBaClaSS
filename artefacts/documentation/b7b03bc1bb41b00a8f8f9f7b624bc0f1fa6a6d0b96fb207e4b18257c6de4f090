     * Attach a custom Factory interface for creating items while using this
     * inflater. This must not be null, and can only be set
     * once; after setting, you can not change the factory. This is called on
     * each element name as the XML is parsed. If the factory returns an item,
     * that is added to the hierarchy. If it returns null, the next factory
     * default {@link #onCreateItem} method is called.
     * <p>
     * If you have an existing inflater and want to add your
     * own factory to it, use {@link #cloneInContext} to clone the existing
     * instance and then you can use this function (once) on the returned new
     * instance. This will merge your own factory with whatever factory the
     * original instance is using.
