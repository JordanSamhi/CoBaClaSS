     * Returns the percentage of a widget's size that's considered as a no-touch
     * zone when swiping. The no-touch zone is set as a percentage of a widget's total
     * width or height, denoting a margin around the swipable area of the widget.
     * Swipes must start and end inside this margin. This is important when the
     * widget being swiped may not respond to the swipe if started at a point
     * too near to the edge. The default is 10% from either edge.
