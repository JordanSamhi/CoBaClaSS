     * Returns whether the network is a background network. A network is a background network if it
     * does not have the NET_CAPABILITY_FOREGROUND capability, which implies it is satisfying no
     * foreground request, is not lingering (i.e. kept for a while after being outscored), and is
     * not a speculative network (i.e. kept pending validation when validation would have it
     * outscore another foreground network). That implies it is being kept up by some background
     * request (otherwise it would be torn down), maybe the mobile always-on request.
