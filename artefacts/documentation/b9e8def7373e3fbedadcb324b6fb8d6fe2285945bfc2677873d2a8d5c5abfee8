     * Note that dismissing PiP is now originated from SystemUI, see {@link #exitPip(int)}.
     * Meanwhile this callback is invoked whenever the task is removed. For instance:
     *   - as a result of removeStacksInWindowingModes from WM
     *   - activity itself is died
     * Nevertheless, we simply update the internal state here as all the heavy lifting should
     * have been done in WM.
