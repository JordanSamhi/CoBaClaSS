     * Installs a memory store.

     * Normally this happens just once, shortly after we start. But wifi can
     * come up before the disk is ready, and we might not yet have a valid wall
     * clock when we start up, so we need to be prepared to begin recording data
     * even if the MemoryStore is not yet available.
     *
     * When the store is installed for the first time, we want to merge any
     * recently recorded data together with data already in the store. But if
     * the store restarts and has to be reinstalled, we don't want to do
     * this merge, because that would risk double-counting the old data.
