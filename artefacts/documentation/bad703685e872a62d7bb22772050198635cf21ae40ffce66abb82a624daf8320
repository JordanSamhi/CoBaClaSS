     * Checks if a specific registered  {@link UiWatcher} has triggered.
     * See {@link #registerWatcher(String, UiWatcher)}. If a UiWatcher runs and its
     * {@link UiWatcher#checkForCondition()} call returned <code>true</code>, then
     * the UiWatcher is considered triggered. This is helpful if a watcher is detecting errors
     * from ANR or crash dialogs and the test needs to know if a UiWatcher has been triggered.
     *
     * @param watcherName
