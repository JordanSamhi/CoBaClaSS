     * Overrides the behavior from the parent class to completely ignore any
     * content notifications sent to this object. This effectively hides clients
     * from observers elsewhere in the system.
     *
     * @deprecated callers should consider migrating to
     *             {@link #notifyChange(Uri, ContentObserver, int)}, as it
     *             offers support for many more options than just
     *             {@link #NOTIFY_SYNC_TO_NETWORK}.
