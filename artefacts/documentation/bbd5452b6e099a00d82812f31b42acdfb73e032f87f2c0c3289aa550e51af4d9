     *
     * <p>Allows a bug report handler app to take bugreports on the user's behalf. The handler can
     * be predefined in the config, meant to be launched with the primary user. The user can
     * override this with a different (or same) handler app on possibly a different user. This is
     * useful for capturing bug reports from work profile, for instance.
     *
     * @return true if there is a bugreport-whitelisted app to handle a bugreport, or false
     * otherwise.
