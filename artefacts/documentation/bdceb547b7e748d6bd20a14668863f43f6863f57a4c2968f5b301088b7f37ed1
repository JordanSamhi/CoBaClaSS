     * This method marks the given native_object as a native allocation of the passed referent.
     * This means that the lifecycle of the native_object can now be attached to the referent and
     * if the referent is disposed, we can safely dispose the delegate.
     * This method is called by the {@link NativeAllocationRegistry_Delegate} and allows the
     * DelegateManager to remove the strong reference to the delegate.
