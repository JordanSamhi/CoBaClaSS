     * Destroy the publish or subscribe session - free any resources, and stop
     * transmitting packets on-air (for an active session) or listening for
     * matches (for a passive session). The session may not be used for any
     * additional operations after its destruction.
     * <p>
     *     This operation must be done on a session which is no longer needed. Otherwise system
     *     resources will continue to be utilized until the application exits. The only
     *     exception is a session for which we received a termination callback,
     *     {@link DiscoverySessionCallback#onSessionTerminated()}.
