     * Conditions are right for a full backup operation, so run one.  The model we use is
     * to perform one app backup per scheduled job execution, and to reschedule the job
     * with zero latency as long as conditions remain right and we still have work to do.
     *
     * <p>This is the "start a full backup operation" entry point called by the scheduled job.
     *
     * @return Whether ongoing work will continue.  The return value here will be passed
     * along as the return value to the scheduled job's onStartJob() callback.
