     * The caller may make subsequent calls through {@link #makeCall}.
     * The IMS service will register the device to the operator's network with the credentials
     * (from ISIM) periodically in order to receive calls from the operator's network.
     * When the IMS service receives a new call, it will call
     * {@link MmTelFeature.Listener#onIncomingCall}
     * @param listener A {@link MmTelFeature.Listener}, which is the interface the
     * {@link MmTelFeature} uses to notify the framework of updates
     * @throws NullPointerException if {@code listener} is null
     * @throws ImsException if calling the IMS service results in an error
