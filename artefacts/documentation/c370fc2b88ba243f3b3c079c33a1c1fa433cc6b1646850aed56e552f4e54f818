     * Retrieve a dimensional unit attribute at <var>index</var> for use
     * as an offset in raw pixels.  This is the same as
     * {@link #getDimension}, except the returned value is converted to
     * integer pixels for you.  An offset conversion involves simply
     * truncating the base value to an integer.
     *
     * @param index Index of attribute to retrieve.
     * @param defValue Value to return if the attribute is not defined or
     *                 not a resource.
     *
     * @return Attribute dimension value multiplied by the appropriate
     * metric and truncated to integer pixels, or defValue if not defined.
