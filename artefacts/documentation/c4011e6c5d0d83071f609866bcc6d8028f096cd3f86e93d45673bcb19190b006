     * stop an ongoing wifi scan
     * @param listener specifies which scan to cancel; must be same object as passed in {@link
     *  #startBackgroundScan}
     * @deprecated Background scan support has always been hardware vendor dependent. This support
     * may not be present on newer devices. Use {@link #startScan(ScanSettings, ScanListener)}
     * instead for single scans.
