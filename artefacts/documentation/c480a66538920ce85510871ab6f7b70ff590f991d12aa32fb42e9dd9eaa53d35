     * Run the recurrence algorithm.  Processes events defined in the local
     * timezone of the event.  Return a list of iCalendar DATETIME
     * strings containing the start date/times of the occurrences; the output
     * times are defined in the local timezone of the event.
     *
     * If you want all of the events, pass Long.MAX_VALUE for rangeEndDateValue.  If you pass
     * Long.MAX_VALUE for rangeEnd, and the event doesn't have a COUNT or UNTIL field,
     * you'll get a DateException.
     *
     * @param dtstart the dtstart date as defined in RFC2445.  This
     * {@link Time} should be in the timezone of the event.
     * @param r the parsed recurrence, as defiend in RFC2445
     * @param rangeStartDateValue the first date-time you care about, inclusive
     * @param rangeEndDateValue the last date-time you care about, not inclusive (so
     *                  if you care about everything up through and including
     *                  Dec 22 1995, set last to Dec 23, 1995 00:00:00
     * @param add Whether or not we should add to out, or remove from out.
     * @param out the TreeSet you'd like to fill with the events
     * @throws DateException
     * @throws android.util.TimeFormatException if r cannot be parsed.
