     * Fetches all app Ids that a given setting is currently visible to, per provided user. This
     * only includes UIDs >= {@link Process#FIRST_APPLICATION_UID} as all other UIDs can already see
     * all applications.
     *
     * If the setting is visible to all UIDs, null is returned. If an app is not visible to any
     * applications, the int array will be empty.
     *
     * @param users            the set of users that should be evaluated for this calculation
     * @param existingSettings the set of all package settings that currently exist on device
     * @return a SparseArray mapping userIds to a sorted int array of appIds that may view the
     * provided setting or null if the app is visible to all and no whitelist should be
     * applied.
