     * Called by keyguard once the host surface for the secondary lockscreen is created and ready to
     * display remote content.
     *
     * <p>Implementations are expected to create a Surface hierarchy with view elements for the
     * admin's desired secondary lockscreen UI, and optionally, interactive elements
     * that will allow the user to dismiss the secondary lockscreen, subject to the implementation's
     * requirements. The view hierarchy is expected to be embedded via the
     * {@link SurfaceControlViewHost} APIs, and returned as a SurfacePackage via
     * {@link SurfaceControlViewHost#getSurfacePackage}for the keyguard to reparent into its
     * prepared SurfaceView.
     *
     * @param hostInputToken Token of the SurfaceView which will hosting the embedded hierarchy,
     *                       primarily required by {@link SurfaceControlViewHost} for ANR reporting.
     *                       It will be provided by the keyguard via
     *                       {@link android.view.SurfaceView#getHostToken}.
     * @return the {@link SurfaceControlViewHost.SurfacePackage} for the Surface the
     *      secondary lockscreen content is attached to.
