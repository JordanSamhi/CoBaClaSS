     * Convert an IPv4 address from an InetAddress to an integer (1.2.3.4 -> 0x01020304)
     *
     * <p>This conversion can help order IP addresses: considering the ordering
     * 192.0.2.1 < 192.0.2.2 < ..., resulting ints will follow that ordering if read as unsigned
     * integers with {@link Integer#toUnsignedLong}.
     * @param inetAddr is an InetAddress corresponding to the IPv4 address
     * @return the IP address as integer
