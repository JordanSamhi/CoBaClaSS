     * Searches for a child element in the present scrollable container. The
     * search first looks for a child element that matches the
     * selector you provided, then looks for the text in its children elements.
     * If both search conditions are fulfilled, the method returns a {@ link UiObject}
     * representing the element matching the selector (not the child element in its
     * subhierarchy containing the text).
