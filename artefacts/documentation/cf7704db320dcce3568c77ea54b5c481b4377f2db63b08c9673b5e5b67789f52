     * Hide content in Overlay Window using {@link OverlayPanelViewController}.
     *
     * This calls {@link OverlayViewGlobalStateController#hideView(OverlayViewController, Runnable)}
     * where the runnable is nullified since the actual hiding of the panel is handled by the
     * controller itself.
