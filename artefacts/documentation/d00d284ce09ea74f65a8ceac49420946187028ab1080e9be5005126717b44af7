         * Unlinks from binder and performs IpSecService resource cleanup (removes from resource
         * arrays)
         *
         * <p>If this method has been previously called, the RefcountedResource's binder field will
         * be null, and the method will return without performing the cleanup a second time.
         *
         * <p>Note that calling this function does not imply that kernel resources will be freed at
         * this time, or that the related quota will be returned. Such actions will only be
         * performed upon the reference count reaching zero.
