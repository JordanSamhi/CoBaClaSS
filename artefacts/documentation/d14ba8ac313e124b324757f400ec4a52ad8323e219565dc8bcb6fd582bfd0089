     * This is triggered from SubscriptionInfoUpdater after sim state change.
     * The sequence of sim loading would be
     *  1. ACTION_SUBINFO_CONTENT_CHANGE
     *  2. ACTION_SIM_STATE_CHANGED/ACTION_SIM_CARD_STATE_CHANGED
     *  /ACTION_SIM_APPLICATION_STATE_CHANGED
     *  3. ACTION_SUBSCRIPTION_CARRIER_IDENTITY_CHANGED
     *
     *  For SIM refresh either reset or init refresh type, SubscriptionInfoUpdater will re-trigger
     *  carrier identification with sim loaded state. Framework today silently handle single file
     *  refresh type.
     *  TODO: check fileId from single file refresh, if the refresh file is IMSI, gid1 or other
     *  records which might change carrier id, framework should trigger sim loaded state just like
     *  other refresh events: INIT or RESET and which will ultimately trigger carrier
     *  re-identification.
