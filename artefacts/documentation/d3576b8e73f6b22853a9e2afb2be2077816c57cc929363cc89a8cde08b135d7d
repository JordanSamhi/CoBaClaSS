     * Marks a content view as freeable, setting it so that future inflations do not reinflate
     * and ensuring that the view is freed when it is safe to remove.
     *
     * @param inflationFlag flag corresponding to the content view to be freed
     * @deprecated By default, {@link NotificationContentInflater#unbindContent} will tell the
     * view hierarchy to only free when the view is safe to remove so this method is no longer
     * needed. Will remove when all uses are gone.
