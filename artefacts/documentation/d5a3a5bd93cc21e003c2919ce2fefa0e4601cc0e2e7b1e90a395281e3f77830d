         * Offload stopped because the device has moved to a bearer on which hardware offload is
         * not supported. Subsequent calls to setUpstreamParameters and add/removeDownstream will
         * likely fail and cannot be presumed to be saved inside of the hardware management process.
         * Upon receiving #onSupportAvailable(), the caller should reprogram the hardware to begin
         * offload again.
