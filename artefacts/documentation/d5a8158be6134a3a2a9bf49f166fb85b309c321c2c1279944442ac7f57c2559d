     * Called when this view is no longer waiting for input focus transfer.
     *
     * There are two scenarios behind this function call. First, input focus transfer
     * has successfully happened and this view already received synthetic DOWN event.
     * (mExpectingSynthesizedDown == false). Do nothing.
     *
     * Second, before input focus transfer finished, user may have lifted finger
     * in previous window and this window never received synthetic DOWN event.
     * (mExpectingSynthesizedDown == true).
     * In this case, we use the velocity to trigger fling event.
     *
     * @param velocity unit is in px / millis
