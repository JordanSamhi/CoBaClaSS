     * Issue a request to the Aware service to create a new Aware publish discovery session, using
     * the specified {@code publishConfig} configuration. The results of the publish operation
     * are routed to the callbacks of {@link DiscoverySessionCallback}:
     * <ul>
     *     <li>
     *     {@link DiscoverySessionCallback#onPublishStarted(
     *PublishDiscoverySession)}
     *     is called when the publish session is created and provides a handle to the session.
     *     Further operations on the publish session can be executed on that object.
     *     <li>{@link DiscoverySessionCallback#onSessionConfigFailed()} is called if the
     *     publish operation failed.
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * Other results of the publish session operations will also be routed to callbacks
     * on the {@code callback} object. The resulting publish session can be modified using
     * {@link PublishDiscoverySession#updatePublish(PublishConfig)}.
     * <p>
     *      An application must use the {@link DiscoverySession#close()} to
     *      terminate the publish discovery session once it isn't needed. This will free
     *      resources as well terminate any on-air transmissions.
     * <p>The application must have the {@link android.Manifest.permission#ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION}
     * permission to start a publish discovery session.
     *
     * @param publishConfig The {@link PublishConfig} specifying the
     *            configuration of the requested publish session.
     * @param callback A {@link DiscoverySessionCallback} derived object to be used for
     *                 session event callbacks.
     * @param handler The Handler on whose thread to execute the callbacks of the {@code
     * callback} object. If a null is provided then the application's main thread will be used.
