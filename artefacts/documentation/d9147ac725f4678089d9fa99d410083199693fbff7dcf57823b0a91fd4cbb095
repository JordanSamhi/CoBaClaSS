         * @param currentDisplayOrientation
         *          The current display orientation, measured counterclockwise
         *          from to the device's natural orientation (in degrees, always
         *          a multiple of 90, and between 0 and 270, inclusive).
         * @param surfaceDimensions
         *          The dimensions of the {@link android.view.Surface} on which
         *          the preview image is being rendered. It usually only makes
         *          sense for the upper-left corner to be at the origin.
         * @param desiredBounds
         *          The boundaries within the {@link android.view.Surface} where
         *          the final image should appear. These can be used to
         *          translate and scale the output, but note that the image will
         *          be stretched to fit, possibly changing its aspect ratio.
         * @return
         *          The transform matrix that should be applied to the
         *          {@link android.view.Surface} in order for the image to
         *          display properly in the device's current orientation.
