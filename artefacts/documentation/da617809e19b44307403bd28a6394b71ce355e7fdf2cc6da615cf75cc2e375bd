     * getOutputHeadsetProbability() reports a probability of a USB Output peripheral being a
     * headset. The probability range is between 0.0f (definitely NOT a headset) and
     * 1.0f (definitely IS a headset). A probability of 0.75f seems sufficient
     * to count on the peripheral being a headset.
