     * end of the current Easy Connect session, and no further callbacks will be called.

     * Note: Easy Connect (DPP) R2, provides additional details for the Configurator when the
     * remote Enrollee is unable to connect to a network. The ssid, channelList and bandList
     * inputs are initialized only for the EASY_CONNECT_EVENT_FAILURE_CANNOT_FIND_NETWORK failure
     * code, and the ssid and bandList are initialized for the
     * EASY_CONNECT_EVENT_FAILURE_ENROLLEE_AUTHENTICATION failure code.

     * @param code Easy Connect failure status code.
     * @param ssid SSID of the network the Enrollee tried to connect to.
     * @param channelListArray List of Global Operating classes and channel sets the Enrollee used
     *                         to scan to find the network, see the "DPP Connection Status Object"
     *                         section in the specification for the format, and Table E-4 in

     *                         The sparse array key is the Global Operating class, and the value
     *                         is an integer array of Wi-Fi channels.
     * @param operatingClassArray Array of bands the Enrollee supports as expressed as the Global
