     * Returns a {@link TrivalentPredicate} function that implements filtering using
     * {@code oldSignal} and {@code newSignal}. The function can return {@code true} or
     * {@code false} and so is intended as the final function in a chain.
     *
     * Function detail: if an NITZ signal received that is too similar to a previous one
     * it should be disregarded if it's received within a configured time period.
     * The general contract for {@link TrivalentPredicate} allows {@code previousSignal} to be
     * {@code null}, but previous functions are expected to prevent it in this case.
