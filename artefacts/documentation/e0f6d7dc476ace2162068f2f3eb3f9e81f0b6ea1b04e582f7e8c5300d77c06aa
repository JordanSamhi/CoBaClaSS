     * <p>
     * TDLS enables two wireless endpoints to talk to each other directly
     * without going through the access point that is managing the local
     * network. It saves bandwidth and improves quality of the link.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * This API enables/disables the option of using TDLS. If enabled, the
     * underlying hardware is free to use TDLS or a hop through the access
     * point. If disabled, existing TDLS session is torn down and
     * hardware is restricted to use access point for transferring wireless
     * packets. Default value for all routes is 'disabled', meaning restricted
     * to use access point for transferring packets.
     * </p>

     * @param remoteIPAddress IP address of the endpoint to setup TDLS with
     * @param enable true = setup and false = tear down TDLS
