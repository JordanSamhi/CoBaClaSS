     * Send one application's data to the backup destination.  The transport may send
     * the data immediately, or may buffer it.  After this is called, {@link #finishBackup}
     * must be called to ensure the data is sent and recorded successfully.
     *
     * @param packageInfo The identity of the application whose data is being backed up.
     *   This specifically includes the signature list for the package.
     * @param inFd Descriptor of file with data that resulted from invoking the application's
     *   BackupService.doBackup() method.  This may be a pipe rather than a file on
     *   persistent media, so it may not be seekable.
     * @param flags Some of {@link BackupTransport#FLAG_USER_INITIATED}.
     * @return one of {@link BackupConstants#TRANSPORT_OK} (OK so far),
     *  {@link BackupConstants#TRANSPORT_ERROR} (on network error or other failure), or
     *  {@link BackupConstants#TRANSPORT_NOT_INITIALIZED} (if the backend dataset has
     *  become lost due to inactive expiry or some other reason and needs re-initializing)
