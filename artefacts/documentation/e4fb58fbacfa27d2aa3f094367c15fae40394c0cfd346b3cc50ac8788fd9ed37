     * Reads the next decrypted bytes into the given buffer.
     *
     * <p>During the first call this method will download the backup file from the server, decrypt
     * it and save it to disk. It will then read the bytes from the file on disk.
     *
     * <p>Once this method has read all the bytes of the file, the caller must call {@link #finish}
     * to clean up.
     *
     * @return the number of bytes read, or {@code -1} on reaching the end of the file
