     * Callback called when new DHCP results are available.
     *
     * <p>This is purely advisory and not an indication of provisioning success or failure.  This is
     * only here for callers that want to expose DHCPv4 results to other APIs
     * (e.g., WifiInfo#setInetAddress).
     *
     * <p>DHCPv4 or static IPv4 configuration failure or success can be determined by whether or not
     * the passed-in DhcpResults object is null.
