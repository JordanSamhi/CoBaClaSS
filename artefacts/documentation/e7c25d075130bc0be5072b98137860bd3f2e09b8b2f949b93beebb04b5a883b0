     * Match the domain names in the ANQP element against the provider's FQDN and SIM credential.
     * The Domain Name ANQP element might contain domains for 3GPP network (e.g.
     * wlan.mnc*.mcc*.3gppnetwork.org), so we should match that against the provider's SIM
     * credential if one is provided.
     *
