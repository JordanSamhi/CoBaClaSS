     * Sets a string value into this tag. This method should be used for tags of
     * type {@link #TYPE_ASCII}. The string is converted to an ASCII string.
     * Characters that cannot be converted are replaced with '?'. The length of
     * the string must be equal to either (component count -1) or (component
     * count). The final byte will be set to the string null terminator '\0',
     * overwriting the last character in the string if the value.length is equal
     * to the component count. This method will fail if:
     * <ul>
     * <li>The data type is not {@link #TYPE_ASCII} or {@link #TYPE_UNDEFINED}.</li>
     * <li>The length of the string is not equal to (component count -1) or
     * (component count) in the definition for this tag.</li>
     * </ul>
