     * Called when an existing user is stopping, for system services to finalize any per-user
     * state they maintain for running users.  This is called prior to sending the SHUTDOWN
     * broadcast to the user; it is a good place to stop making use of any resources of that
     * user (such as binding to a service running in the user).
     *
     * <p>This method is only called when the service {@link #isUserSupported(TargetUser) supports}
     * this user.
     *
     * <p>NOTE: This is the last callback where the callee may access the target user's CE storage.
