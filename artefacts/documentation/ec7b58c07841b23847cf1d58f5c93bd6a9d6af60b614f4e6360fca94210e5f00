     * This is a helper function to be called at the end of all RadioResponse callbacks for
     * radio HAL fallback cases. It takes care of logging, decrementing wakelock if needed, and
     * releases the request from memory pool. Unlike processResponseDone, it will not send
     * error response to caller.
     * @param rr RILRequest for which response callback was called
     * @param responseInfo RadioResponseInfo received in the callback
     * @param ret object to be returned to request sender
