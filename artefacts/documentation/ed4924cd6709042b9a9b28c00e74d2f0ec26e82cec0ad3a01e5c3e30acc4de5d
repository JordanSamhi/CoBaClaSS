     * Register a local service for service discovery. If a local service is registered,
     * the framework automatically responds to a service discovery request from a peer.
     *
     * <p> The function call immediately returns after sending a request to add a local
     * service to the framework. The application is notified of a success or failure to
     * add service through listener callbacks {@link ActionListener#onSuccess} or
     * {@link ActionListener#onFailure}.
     *
     * <p>The service information is set through {@link WifiP2pServiceInfo}.<br>
     * or its subclass calls  {@link WifiP2pUpnpServiceInfo#newInstance} or
     *  {@link WifiP2pDnsSdServiceInfo#newInstance} for a Upnp or Bonjour service
     * respectively
     *
     * <p>The service information can be cleared with calls to
     *  {@link #removeLocalService} or {@link #clearLocalServices}.
     *
     * @param c is the channel created at {@link #initialize}
     * @param servInfo is a local service information.
     * @param listener for callbacks on success or failure. Can be null.
