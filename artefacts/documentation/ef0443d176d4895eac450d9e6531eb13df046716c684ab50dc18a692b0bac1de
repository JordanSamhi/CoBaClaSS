     * Cancels a pending local only hotspot request.  This can be used by the calling application to
     * cancel the existing request if the provided callback has not been triggered.  Calling this
     * method will be equivalent to closing the returned LocalOnlyHotspotReservation, but it is not
     * explicitly required.
     * <p>
     * When cancelling this request, application developers should be aware that there may still be
     * outstanding local only hotspot requests and the hotspot may still start, or continue running.
     * Additionally, if a callback was registered, it will no longer be triggered after calling
     * cancel.
