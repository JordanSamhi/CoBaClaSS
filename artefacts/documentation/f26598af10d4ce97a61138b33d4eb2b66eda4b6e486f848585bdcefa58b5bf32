     * Register a listener that will receive results from all single scans.
     * Either the {@link ScanListener#onSuccess()} or  {@link ScanListener#onFailure(int, String)}
     * method will be called once when the listener is registered.
     * Afterwards (assuming onSuccess was called), all subsequent single scan results will be
     * delivered to the listener. It is possible that onFullResult will not be called for all
     * results of the first scan if the listener was registered during the scan.
     *
     * @param executor the Executor on which to run the callback.
     * @param listener specifies the object to report events to. This object is also treated as a
     *                 key for this request, and must also be specified to cancel the request.
     *                 Multiple requests should also not share this object.
