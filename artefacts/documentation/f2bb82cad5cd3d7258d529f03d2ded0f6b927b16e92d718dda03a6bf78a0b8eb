     * Set the allowed network types of the device and
     * provide the reason triggering the allowed network change.
     * This can be called for following reasons
     * <ol>
     * <li>Allowed network types control by power manager
     * {@link #ALLOWED_NETWORK_TYPES_REASON_POWER}
     * </ol>
     * This API will result in allowing an intersection of allowed network types for all reasons,
     * including the configuration done through {@link setAllowedNetworkTypes}.
     * While this API and {@link setAllowedNetworkTypes} is controlling allowed network types
     * on device, user preference will still be set through {@link #setPreferredNetworkTypeBitmask}.
     * Thus resultant network type configured on modem will be an intersection of the network types
     * from setAllowedNetworkTypesForReason, {@link setAllowedNetworkTypes}
     * and {@link #setPreferredNetworkTypeBitmask}.
     *
     * @param reason the reason the allowed network type change is taking place
     * @param allowedNetworkTypes The bitmask of allowed network types.
     * @throws IllegalStateException if the Telephony process is not currently available.
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if invalid AllowedNetworkTypesReason is passed.
