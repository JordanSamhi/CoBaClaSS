     * Performs the traversal to find a view by its unique and stable accessibility id.
     *
     * <strong>Note:</strong>This method does not stop at the root namespace
     * boundary since the user can touch the screen at an arbitrary location
     * potentially crossing the root namespace boundary which will send an
     * accessibility event to accessibility services and they should be able
     * to obtain the event source. Also accessibility ids are guaranteed to be
     * unique in the window.
     *
     * @param accessibilityId The accessibility id.
     * @return The found view.
