     * Enable or disable monkey test mode.
     *
     * Setting test as "monkey" indicates to some applications that a test framework is
     * running as a "monkey" type. Such applications may choose not to perform actions that
     * do submits so to avoid allowing monkey tests from doing harm or performing annoying
     * actions such as dialing 911 or posting messages to public forums, etc.
     *
     * @param isSet True to set as monkey test. False to set as regular functional test (default).
