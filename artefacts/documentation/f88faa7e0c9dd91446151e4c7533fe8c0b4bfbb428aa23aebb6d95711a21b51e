          * Provides a hint to SurfaceFlinger to change its offset so that SurfaceFlinger wakes up
          * earlier to compose surfaces. The caller should use this as a hint to SurfaceFlinger
          * when the scene is complex enough to use GPU composition. The hint will remain active
          * until until the client calls {@link Transaction#setEarlyWakeupEnd}.
