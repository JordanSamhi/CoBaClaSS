     * The display is blanked when the level is 0.0.  In normal use, the electron
     * beam should have a value of 1.0.  The electron beam is unstable in between
     * these states and the picture quality may be compromised.  For best effect,
     * the electron beam should be warmed up or cooled off slowly.
     *
     * Warning: Electron beam emits harmful radiation.  Avoid direct exposure to
     * skin or eyes.
