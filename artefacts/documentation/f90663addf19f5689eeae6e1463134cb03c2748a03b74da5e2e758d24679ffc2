     * Register a callback object for RTT life-cycle events. The callback object registration
     * indicates that an RTT controller should be created whenever possible. The callback object
     * will be called with a new RTT controller whenever it is created (or at registration time
     * if an RTT controller already exists). The callback object will also be triggered whenever
     * an existing RTT controller is destroyed (the previous copies must be discarded by the
     * recipient).
