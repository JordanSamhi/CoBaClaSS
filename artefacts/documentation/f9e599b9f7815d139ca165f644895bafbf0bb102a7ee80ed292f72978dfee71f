     * Called when the process hosting a callback in the list has gone away.
     * The default implementation calls {@link #onCallbackDied(E)}
     * for backwards compatibility.
     * 
     * @param callback The callback whose process has died.  Note that, since
     * its process has died, you can not make any calls on to this interface.
     * You can, however, retrieve its IBinder and compare it with another
     * IBinder to see if it is the same object.
     * @param cookie The cookie object original provided to
     * {@link #register(E, Object)}.
     * 
     * @see #register
