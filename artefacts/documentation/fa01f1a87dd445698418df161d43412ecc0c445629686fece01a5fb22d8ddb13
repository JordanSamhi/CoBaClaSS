     * Returns a platform configuration for WFC which may override the user
     * setting. Note: WFC presumes that VoLTE is enabled (these are
     * configuration settings which must be done correctly).
     *
     * @deprecated Doesn't work for MSIM devices. Use {@link #isWfcEnabledByPlatform()}
     * instead.
