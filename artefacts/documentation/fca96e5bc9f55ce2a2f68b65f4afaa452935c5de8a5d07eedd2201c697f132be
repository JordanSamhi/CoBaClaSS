     * We intercept notification entries (including group summaries) dismissed by the user when
     * there is an active bubble associated with it. We do this so that developers can still
     * cancel it (and hence the bubbles associated with it). However, these intercepted
     * notifications should then be hidden from the shade since the user has cancelled them, so we
     *  {@link Bubble#setSuppressNotification}.  For the case of suppressed summaries, we also add
     *  {@link BubbleData#addSummaryToSuppress}.
     *
     * @return true if we want to intercept the dismissal of the entry, else false.
