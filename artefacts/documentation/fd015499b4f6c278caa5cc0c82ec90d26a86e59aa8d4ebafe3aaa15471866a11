         * Causes the string message for the event to appear in the logcat.
         * Here is an example of how to create a new event (a StringEvent), adding it to the logger
         * (an instance of SoundTriggerLogger) while also making it show in the logcat:
         * <pre>
         *     myLogger.log(
         *         (new StringEvent("something for logcat and logger")).printLog(MyClass.TAG) );
         * </pre>
         * @param tag the tag for the android.util.Log.v
         * @return the same instance of the event
