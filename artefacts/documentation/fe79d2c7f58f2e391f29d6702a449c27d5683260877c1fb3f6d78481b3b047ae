     * Get CellIdentity from the ServiceState if available or guess from cached
     *
     * Get the CellIdentity by first checking if ServiceState has a current CID. If so
     * then return that info. Otherwise, check the latest List<CellInfo> and return the first GSM or
     * WCDMA result that appears. If no GSM or WCDMA results, then return an LTE result. The
     * behavior is kept consistent for backwards compatibility; (do not apply logic to determine
     * why the behavior is this way).
     *
     * @return the current cell location if known or a non-null "empty" cell location
