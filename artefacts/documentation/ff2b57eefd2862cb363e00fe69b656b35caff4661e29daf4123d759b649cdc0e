     * Continue an operation which failed with a user-resolvable error.

     * <p>The implementation here makes a key assumption that the resolutionIntent has not been
     * tampered with. This is guaranteed because:
     * <UL>
     * <LI>The intent is wrapped in a PendingIntent created by the phone process which is created
     * with {@link #EXTRA_OPERATION} already present. This means that the operation cannot be
     * overridden on the PendingIntent - a caller can only add new extras.
     * <LI>The resolution activity is restricted by a privileged permission; unprivileged apps
     * cannot start it directly. So the PendingIntent is the only way to start it.
     * </UL>
