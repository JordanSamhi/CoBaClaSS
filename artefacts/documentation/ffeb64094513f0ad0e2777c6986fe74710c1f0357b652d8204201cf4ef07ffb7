     * Returns the current time in milliseconds
     *
     * This time is to be passed into the update methods.
     * The scoring methods generally don't need a particular epoch, depending
     * only on deltas. So a different time source may be used, as long as it is consistent.
     *
     * Note that when there are long intervals between updates, it is unlikely to matter much
     * how large the interval is, so a time source that does not update while the processor is
     * asleep could be just fine.
     *
     * @return millisecond-resolution time.
