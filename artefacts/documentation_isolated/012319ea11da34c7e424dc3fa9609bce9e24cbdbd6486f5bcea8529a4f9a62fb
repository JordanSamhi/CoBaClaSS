     * Send a SurfaceControl transaction to the server, which the server will apply in sync with
     * the next bounds change. As this uses deferred transaction and not BLAST it is only
     * able to sync with a single window, and the first visible window in this hierarchy of type
     * BASE_APPLICATION to resize will be used. If there are bound changes included in this
     * WindowContainer transaction (from setBounds or scheduleFinishEnterPip), the SurfaceControl
     * transaction will be synced with those bounds. If there are no changes, then
     * the SurfaceControl transaction will be synced with the next bounds change. This means
     * that you can call this, apply the WindowContainer transaction, and then later call
     * dismissPip() to achieve synchronization.
