     * joins. If {@code audioGroup} is null, then the {@code AudioGroup} object
     * will be dynamically created when needed. Note that the mode of the
     * {@code AudioGroup} is not changed according to the audio settings (i.e.,
     * hold, mute, speaker phone) of this object. This is mainly used to merge
     * multiple {@code SipAudioCall} objects to form a conference call. The
     * settings of the first object (that merges others) override others'.
