     * Set or remove an agent to be run whenever an app with the given process name starts.
     *
     * This method will not check whether the given process name matches a debuggable app. That
     * would require scanning all current packages, and a rescan when new packages are installed
     * or updated.
     *
     * Instead, do the check when an application is started and matched to a stored agent.
     *
     * @param packageName the process name of the app.
     * @param agent the agent string to be used, or null to remove any previously set agent.
