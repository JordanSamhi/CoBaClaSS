     * Sets a listener for update events in the underlying ValueAnimator that runs
     * the property animations. Note that the underlying animator is animating between
     * 0 and 1 (these values are then turned into the actual property values internally
     * by ViewPropertyAnimator). So the animator cannot give information on the current
     * values of the properties being animated by this ViewPropertyAnimator, although
     * the view object itself can be queried to get the current values.

     *
     * @param listener The listener to be called with update events. A value of
     * <code>null</code> removes any existing listener.
     * @return This object, allowing calls to methods in this class to be chained.
