     * Stop or abort a current Easy Connect (DPP) session. This call, once processed, will
     * terminate any ongoing transaction, and clean up all associated resources. Caller should not
     * expect any callbacks once this call is made. However, due to the asynchronous nature of
     * this call, a callback may be fired if it was already pending in the queue.
