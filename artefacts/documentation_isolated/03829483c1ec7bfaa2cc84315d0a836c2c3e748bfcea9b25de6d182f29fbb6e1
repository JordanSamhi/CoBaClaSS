     * Returns a platform configuration for VT which may override the user setting.
     *
     * Note: VT presumes that VoLTE is enabled (these are configuration settings
     * which must be done correctly).
     *
     * @deprecated Does not support MSIM devices. Please use
     * {@link #isVtEnabledByPlatform()} instead.
