     * Expands the recurrence within the given range using the given dtstart
     * value. Returns an array of longs where each element is a date in UTC
     * milliseconds. The return value is never null.  If there are no dates
     * then an array of length zero is returned.
     *
     * @param dtstart a Time object representing the first occurrence
     * @param recur the recurrence rules, including RRULE, RDATES, EXRULE, and
     * EXDATES
     * @param rangeStartMillis the beginning of the range to expand, in UTC
     * milliseconds
     * @param rangeEndMillis the non-inclusive end of the range to expand, in
     * UTC milliseconds; use -1 for the entire range.
     * @return an array of dates, each date is in UTC milliseconds
     * @throws DateException
     * @throws android.util.TimeFormatException if recur cannot be parsed
