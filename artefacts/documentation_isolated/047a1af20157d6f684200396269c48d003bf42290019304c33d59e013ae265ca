     * Method used by layoutlib to ensure that {@link Class} instances are not cached by this
     * class. Caching the {@link Class} instances will lead to leaking the {@link ClassLoader}
     * used by that class.
     * In layoutlib, these class loaders are instantiated dynamically to allow for new classes to
     * be loaded when the user code changes.
