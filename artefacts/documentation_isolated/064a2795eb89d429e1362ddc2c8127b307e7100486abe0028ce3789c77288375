     * Adds a drop shadow to a semi-transparent image (of an arbitrary shape) and returns it as a
     * new image. This method attempts to mimic the same visual characteristics as the rectangular
     * shadow painting methods in this class, {@link #createRectangularDropShadow(java.awt.image.BufferedImage)}
     * and {@link #createSmallRectangularDropShadow(java.awt.image.BufferedImage)}.
     * <p/>
     * If shadowSize is less or equals to 1, no shadow will be painted and the source image will be
     * returned instead.
     *
     * @param source the source image
     * @param shadowSize the size of the shadow, normally {@link #SHADOW_SIZE or {@link
     * #SMALL_SHADOW_SIZE}}
     * @param alpha alpha value to apply to the shadow
     *
     * @return an image with the shadow painted in or the source image if shadowSize <= 1
