     * <p>This method will start a networking module either in the network stack
     * process, or inside the system server on devices that do not support the corresponding
     * mainline network . The corresponding networking module service's binder
     * object will then be delivered asynchronously via the provided {@link ModuleServiceCallback}.

     * @param serviceIntentBaseAction Base action to use for constructing the intent needed to
     *                                bind to the corresponding module.
     * @param servicePermissionName Permission to be held by the corresponding module.
