         * Unlocks the Wi-Fi radio, allowing it to turn off when the device is idle.
         *
         * If this WifiLock is reference-counted, each call to {@code release} will decrement the
         * reference count, and the radio will be unlocked only when the reference count reaches
         * zero.  If the reference count goes below zero (that is, if {@code release} is called
         * a greater number of times than {@link #acquire}), an exception is thrown.
         *
         * If this WifiLock is not reference-counted, the first call to {@code release} (after
         * the radio was locked using {@link #acquire}) will unlock the radio, and subsequent
         * calls will be ignored.
