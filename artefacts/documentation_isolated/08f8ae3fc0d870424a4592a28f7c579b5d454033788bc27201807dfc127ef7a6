     * Select one of the pre-configured TX power level scenarios or reset it back to normal.
     * Primarily used for meeting SAR requirements during voice calls.
     *
     * Note: If it was found out that the scenario to be reported is the same as last reported one,
     *       then exit with success.
     *       This is to handle the case when some HAL versions deal with different inputs equally,
     *       in that case, we should not call the hal unless there is a change in scenario.
     * Note: It is assumed that this method is only called if SAR is enabled. The logic of whether
     *       to call it or not resides in SarManager class.
     *
     * @param sarInfo The collection of inputs to select the SAR scenario.
     * @return true for success; false for failure or if the HAL version does not support this API.
