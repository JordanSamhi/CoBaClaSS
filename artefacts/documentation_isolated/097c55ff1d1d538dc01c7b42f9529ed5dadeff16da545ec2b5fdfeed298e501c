     * Initiates a pull of an external call.
     *
     * Initiates a pull by making a dial request with the {@link ImsCallProfile#EXTRA_IS_CALL_PULL}
     * extra specified.  We call {@link ImsPhone#notifyUnknownConnection(Connection)} which notifies
     * Telecom of the new dialed connection.  The
     * {@code PstnIncomingCallNotifier#maybeSwapWithUnknownConnection} logic ensures that the new
     * {@link ImsPhoneConnection} resulting from the dial gets swapped with the
     * {@link ImsExternalConnection}, which effectively makes the external call become a regular
     * call.  Magic!
     *
     * @param number The phone number of the call to be pulled.
     * @param videoState The desired video state of the pulled call.
     * @param dialogId The {@link ImsExternalConnection#getCallId()} dialog id associated with the
     *                 call which is being pulled.
