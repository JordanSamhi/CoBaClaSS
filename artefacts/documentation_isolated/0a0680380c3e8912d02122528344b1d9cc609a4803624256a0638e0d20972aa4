     * Set the visibility of the button by {@param buttonResId} with {@param visible}. Only one
     * button is shown at a time. The input button will only show up if it has higher priority than
     * a previous button, otherwise it will be marked as visible and shown later if all higher
     * priority buttons are invisible. Therefore hiding a button will show the next marked visible
     * button. This group's view will be visible if at least one button is visible.
     * @return if the button is visible after operation
     * @throws RuntimeException if the input id does not match any of the ids in the group
