     * <ul>
     * <li>Embedded (but see note about {@code includeNonRemovableSubscriptions}, or
     * <li>In the given list of current embedded ICCIDs (which may not yet be in the database, or

     * @param embeddedIccids all ICCIDs of available embedded subscriptions. This is used to surface
     *     entries for profiles which had been previously deleted.
     * @param isEuiccRemovable whether the current ICCID is removable. Non-removable subscriptions
     *     will only be returned if the current ICCID is not removable; otherwise, they are left
     *     alone (not returned here unless in the embeddedIccids list) under the assumption that
     *     they will still be accessible when the eUICC containing them is activated.
