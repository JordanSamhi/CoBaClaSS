     * Write a heterogeneous array of Parcelable objects into the Parcel.
     * Each object in the array is written along with its class name, so
     * that the correct class can later be instantiated.  As a result, this
     * has significantly more overhead than {@link #writeTypedArray}, but will
     * correctly handle an array containing more than one type of object.
     *
     * @param value The array of objects to be written.
     * @param parcelableFlags Contextual flags as per
     * {@link Parcelable#writeToParcel(Parcel, int) Parcelable.writeToParcel()}.
     *
     * @see #writeTypedArray
