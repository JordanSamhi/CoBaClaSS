     * Rounds a time to the nearest multiple of the provided threshold. Note: This function takes
     * the absolute value of the inputs since it is only meant to be used for times, not general
     * purpose rounding.
     *
     * ex: roundTimeToNearestThreshold(41, 24) = 48
     * @param drainTime The amount to round
     * @param threshold The value to round to a multiple of
     * @return The rounded value as a long
