     * Searches for a child element in the present scrollable container.
     * The search first looks for a child element that matches the selector
     * you provided, then looks for the content-description in its children elements.
     * If both search conditions are fulfilled, the method returns a {@ link UiObject}
     * representing the element matching the selector (not the child element in its
     * subhierarchy containing the content-description). By default, this method performs a
     * scroll search.
     * See {@link #getChildByDescription(UiSelector, String, boolean)}

     * @param childPattern {@link UiSelector} for a child in a scollable layout element
