     * Initiate a sync. This can start a sync for all providers
     * (pass null to url, set onlyTicklable to false), only those
     * providers that are marked as ticklable (pass null to url,
     * set onlyTicklable to true), or a specific provider (set url
     * to the content url of the provider).
     *
     * <p>If the ContentResolver.SYNC_EXTRAS_UPLOAD boolean in extras is
     * true then initiate a sync that just checks for local changes to send
     * to the server, otherwise initiate a sync that first gets any
     * changes from the server before sending local changes back to
     * the server.
     *
     * <p>If a specific provider is being synced (the url is non-null)
     * then the extras can contain SyncAdapter-specific information
     * to control what gets synced (e.g. which specific feed to sync).
     *
     * <p>You'll start getting callbacks after this.
     *
     * @param requestedAccount the account to sync, may be null to signify all accounts
     * @param userId the id of the user whose accounts are to be synced. If userId is USER_ALL,
     *          then all users' accounts are considered.
     * @param reason for sync request. If this is a positive integer, it is the Linux uid
     * assigned to the process that requested the sync. If it's negative, the sync was requested by
     * the SyncManager itself and could be one of the following:
     *      {@link SyncOperation#REASON_BACKGROUND_DATA_SETTINGS_CHANGED}
     *      {@link SyncOperation#REASON_ACCOUNTS_UPDATED}
     *      {@link SyncOperation#REASON_SERVICE_CHANGED}
     *      {@link SyncOperation#REASON_PERIODIC}
     *      {@link SyncOperation#REASON_IS_SYNCABLE}
     *      {@link SyncOperation#REASON_SYNC_AUTO}
     *      {@link SyncOperation#REASON_MASTER_SYNC_AUTO}
     *      {@link SyncOperation#REASON_USER_START}
     * @param requestedAuthority the authority to sync, may be null to indicate all authorities
     * @param extras a Map of SyncAdapter-specific information to control
     *          syncs of a specific provider. Can be null. Is ignored
     *          if the url is null.
     * @param targetSyncState Only sync authorities that have the specified sync state.
     *           Use {@link AuthorityInfo#UNDEFINED} to sync all authorities.
