         * Configure the Soft AP to require manual user control of client association.
         * If disabled (the default) then any client which isn't in the blocked list
         * {@link #getBlockedClientList()} can associate to this Soft AP using the
         * correct credentials until the Soft AP capacity is reached (capacity is hardware, carrier,
         * or user limited - using {@link #setMaxNumberOfClients(int)}).
         *
         * If manual user control is enabled then clients will be accepted, rejected, or require
         * a user approval based on the configuration provided by
         * {@link #setBlockedClientList(List)} and {@link #setAllowedClientList(List)}.
         *
         * <p>
         * This method requires hardware support. Hardware support can be determined using
         * {@link WifiManager.SoftApCallback#onCapabilityChanged(SoftApCapability)} and
         * {@link SoftApCapability#areFeaturesSupported(int)}
         * with {@link SoftApCapability.SOFTAP_FEATURE_CLIENT_FORCE_DISCONNECT}
         *
         * <p>
         * If the method is called on a device without hardware support then starting the soft AP
         * using {@link WifiManager#startTetheredHotspot(SoftApConfiguration)} will fail with
         * {@link WifiManager#SAP_START_FAILURE_UNSUPPORTED_CONFIGURATION}.
         *

         * <li>If not set, defaults to false (i.e The authoriztion is not required).</li>

         * @param enabled true for enabling the control by user, false otherwise.
         * @return Builder for chaining.
