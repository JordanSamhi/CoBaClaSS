     * Reset the current AF state.
     *
     * <p>
     * When dropping capture results (by not invoking {@link #onCaptureCompleted} when a new
     * {@link CaptureResult} is available), call this function to reset the state. Otherwise
     * the next time a new state is observed this class may incorrectly consider it as the same
     * state as before, and not issue any callbacks by {@link AutoFocusStateListener}.
     * </p>
