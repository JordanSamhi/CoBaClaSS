     * Call this method before the first call to {@link #getActivity} to inject a customized Intent
     * into the Activity under test.
     *
     * <p>If you do not call this, the default intent will be provided.  If you call this after
     * your Activity has been started, it will have no effect.
     *
     * <p><b>NOTE:</b> Activities under test may not be started from within the UI thread.
     * If your test method is annotated with {@link android.test.UiThreadTest}, then you must call
     * {@link #setActivityIntent(Intent)} from {@link #setUp()}.
     *
     * <p>The default Intent (if this method is not called) is:
     *  action = {@link Intent#ACTION_MAIN}
     *  flags = {@link Intent#FLAG_ACTIVITY_NEW_TASK}
     * All other fields are null or empty.
     *
     * @param i The Intent to start the Activity with, or null to reset to the default Intent.
