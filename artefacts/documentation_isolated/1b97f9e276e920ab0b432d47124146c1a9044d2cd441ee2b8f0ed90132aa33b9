         * Called when the session refuses the controller or the controller is disconnected from
         * the session. The controller becomes unavailable afterwards and the callback wouldn't
         * be called.
         * <p>
         * It will be also called after the {@link #close()}, so you can put clean up code here.
         * You don't need to call {@link #close()} after this.
         *
         * @param controller the controller for this event
