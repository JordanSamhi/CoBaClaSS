     * @return returns a fraction that describes where along the {@param movementBounds} the
     *         {@param stackBounds} are. If the {@param stackBounds} are not currently on the
     *         {@param movementBounds} exactly, then they will be snapped to the movement bounds.
     *
     *         The fraction is defined in a clockwise fashion against the {@param movementBounds}:
     *
     *            0   1
     *          4 +---+ 1
     *            |   |
     *          3 +---+ 2
     *            3   2
