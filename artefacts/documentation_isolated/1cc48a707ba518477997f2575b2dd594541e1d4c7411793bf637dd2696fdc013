     * Workaround for b/62528361, at the time recents has drawn, it may happen before a
     * configuration change to the Divider, and internally, the event will be posted to the
     * subscriber, or DividerView, which has been removed and prevented from resizing. Instead,
     * register the event handler here and proxy the event to the current DividerView.
