     * Called when an existing user is in the process of being unlocked. This
     * means the credential-encrypted storage for that user is now available,
     * and encryption-aware component filtering is no longer in effect.
     * <p>
     * While dispatching this event to services, the user is in the
     * {@code STATE_RUNNING_UNLOCKING} state, and once dispatching is finished
     * the user will transition into the {@code STATE_RUNNING_UNLOCKED} state.
     * Code written inside system services should use
     * {@link UserManager#isUserUnlockingOrUnlocked(int)} to handle both of
     * these states, or use {@link #onUserUnlocked(TargetUser)} instead.
     * <p>
     * This method is only called when the service {@link #isUserSupported(TargetUser) supports}
     * this user.
     *
     * @param user target user
