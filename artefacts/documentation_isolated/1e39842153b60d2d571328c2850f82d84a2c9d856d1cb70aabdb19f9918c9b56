     * Constructs and returns a PropertyValuesHolder with a given property and
     * set of Object values. This variant also takes a TypeEvaluator because the system
     * cannot automatically interpolate between objects of unknown type.
     *
     * <p><strong>Note:</strong> The Object values are stored as references to the original
     * objects, which means that changes to those objects after this method is called will
     * affect the values on the PropertyValuesHolder. If the objects will be mutated externally
     * after this method is called, callers should pass a copy of those objects instead.
     *
     * @param property The property being animated. Should not be null.
     * @param evaluator A TypeEvaluator that will be called on each animation frame to
     * provide the necessary interpolation between the Object values to derive the animated
     * value.
     * @param values The values that the property will animate between.
     * @return PropertyValuesHolder The constructed PropertyValuesHolder object.
