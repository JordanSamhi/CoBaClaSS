     * Disable Wi-Fi RTT responder mode on the device. The {@code callback} needs to be the
     * same one used in {@link #enableResponder(ResponderCallback)}.
     * <p>
     * Calling this method when responder isn't enabled won't have any effect. The callback can be
     * reused for enabling responder after this method is called.
     * <p>
     * This method is deprecated and will throw an {@link UnsupportedOperationException}
     * exception. Please use the {@link WifiRttManager} API to perform a Wi-Fi Aware peer-to-peer
     * ranging.
     *
     * @param callback The same callback used for enabling responder.
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException If {@code callback} is null.
