     * Gets the {@link AudioGroup} object which the {@link AudioStream} object
     * joins. The group object may not exist before the call is established.
     * Also, the {@code AudioStream} may change its group during a call (e.g.,
     * after the call is held/un-held). Finally, the {@code AudioGroup} object
     * returned by this method is undefined after the call ends or the
     * {@link #close} method is called. If a group object is set by
     * {@link #setAudioGroup(AudioGroup)}, then this method returns that object.
     *
     * @return the {@link AudioGroup} object or null if the RTP stream has not
     *      yet been set up
     * @see #getAudioStream
