     * @param areas The areas for autoexposure. The coordinate system has domain
     *              and range [-1000,1000], measured relative to the visible
     *              preview image, with orientation matching that of the sensor.
     *              This means the coordinates must be transformed to account
     *              for the devices rotation---but not the zoom level---before
     *              being passed into this method.
