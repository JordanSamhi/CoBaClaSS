     * Sets the listener to be invoked invoked when the transaction completes.
     *
     * This function provides an asynchronous approach to retrieve the result of the
     * transaction. When the transaction response has been provided by the Context Hub,
     * the given listener will be invoked.
     *
     * If the transaction has already completed at the time of invocation, the listener
     * will be immediately invoked. If the transaction has been invalidated,
     * the listener will never be invoked.
     *
     * A transaction can be invalidated if the process owning the transaction is no longer active
     * and the reference to this object is lost.
     *
     * This method or {@link #setOnCompleteListener(ContextHubTransaction.OnCompleteListener)} can
     * only be invoked once, or an IllegalStateException will be thrown.
     *
     * @param listener the listener to be invoked upon completion
     * @param executor the executor to invoke the callback
     *
     * @throws IllegalStateException if this method is called multiple times
     * @throws NullPointerException if the callback or handler is null
