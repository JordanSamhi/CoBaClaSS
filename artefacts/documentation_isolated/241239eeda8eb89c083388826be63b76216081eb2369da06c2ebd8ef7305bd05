     * Return a currently registered callback.  Note that this is
     * <em>not</em> the same as {@link #getBroadcastItem} and should not be used
     * interchangeably with it.  This method returns the registered callback at the given
     * index, not the current broadcast state.  This means that it is not itself thread-safe:
     * any call to {@link #register} or {@link #unregister} will change these indices, so you
     * must do your own thread safety between these to protect from such changes.
     *
     * @param index Index of which callback registration to return, from 0 to
     * {@link #getRegisteredCallbackCount()} - 1.
     *
     * @return Returns whatever callback is associated with this index, or null if
     * {@link #kill()} has been called.
