     * Sets an input filter that will receive all input events before they are dispatched.
     * The input filter may then reinterpret input events or inject new ones.
     *
     * To ensure consistency, the input dispatcher automatically drops all events
     * in progress whenever an input filter is installed or uninstalled.  After an input
     * filter is uninstalled, it can no longer send input events unless it is reinstalled.
     * Any events it attempts to send after it has been uninstalled will be dropped.
     *
     * @param filter The input filter, or null to remove the current filter.
