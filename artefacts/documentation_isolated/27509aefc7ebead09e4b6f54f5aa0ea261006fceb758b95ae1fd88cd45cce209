     * Applies the interpolator and length to the animator, such that the fling animation is
     * consistent with the finger motion.
     *
     * @param animator the animator to apply
     * @param currValue the current value
     * @param endValue the end value of the animator
     * @param velocity the current velocity of the motion
     * @param maxDistance the maximum distance for this interaction; the maximum animation length
     *                    gets multiplied by the ratio between the actual distance and this value
