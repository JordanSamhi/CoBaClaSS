     * An equals method can exclude the caption insets. This is useful because we assemble the
     * caption insets information on the client side, and when we communicate with server, it's
     * excluded.
     * @param excludingCaptionInsets {@code true} if we want to compare two InsetsState objects but
     *                                           ignore the caption insets source value.
     * @param excludeInvisibleImeFrames If {@link #ITYPE_IME} frames should be ignored when IME is
     *                                  not visible.
     * @return {@code true} if the two InsetsState objects are equal, {@code false} otherwise.
