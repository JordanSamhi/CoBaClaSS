     * Clears the existing text contents in an editable field.
     *
     * The {@link UiSelector} of this object must reference a UI element that is editable.
     *
     * When you call this method, the method first sets focus at the start edge of the field.
     * The method then simulates a long-press to select the existing text, and deletes the
     * selected text.
     *
     * If a "Select-All" option is displayed, the method will automatically attempt to use it
     * to ensure full text selection.
     *
     * Note that it is possible that not all the text in the field is selected; for example,
     * if the text contains separators such as spaces, slashes, at symbol etc.
     * Also, not all editable fields support the long-press functionality.
