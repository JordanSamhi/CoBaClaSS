     * Query if a given compatibility change is enabled for the current process. This method should
     * only be called by code running inside a process of the affected app.
     *
     * <p>If this method returns {@code true}, the calling code should implement the compatibility
     * change, resulting in differing behaviour compared to earlier releases. If this method returns
     * {@code false}, the calling code should behave as it did in earlier releases.
     *
     * <p>When this method returns {@code true}, it will also report the change as
     * {@link #reportChange(long)} would, so there is no need to call that method directly.
     *
     * @param changeId The ID of the compatibility change in question.
     * @return {@code true} if the change is enabled for the current app.
