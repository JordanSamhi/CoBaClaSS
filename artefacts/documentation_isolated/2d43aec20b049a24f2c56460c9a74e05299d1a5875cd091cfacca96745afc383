     * Calculates the insets from the {@code outerFrame} to the {@code innerFrame}.
     *
     * Note that if a side of the outer frame is not actually on the outside, the inset for that
     * side will be clamped to zero.
     *
     * @param outerFrame the reference frame from which the insets are calculated
     * @param innerFrame the inset frame, to which the insets are calculated,
     *                   or null to clear the insets.
     * @param outInsets is set to the result of the inset calculation.
