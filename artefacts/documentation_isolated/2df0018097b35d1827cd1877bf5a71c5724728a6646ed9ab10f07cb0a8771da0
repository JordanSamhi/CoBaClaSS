     * Tracks a request to resume the video for a source (see {@link #SOURCE_DATA_ENABLED},
     * {@link #SOURCE_INCALL}) and determines whether a resume request should be issued to the

     *
     * We want to issue a resume request to the provider when we have issued a corresponding
     * resume for each previously issued pause.
     *
     * @param source The source of the resume request.
     * @return {@code true} if a resume should be issued to the
     *      {@link ImsVideoCallProvider}, {@code false} otherwise.
