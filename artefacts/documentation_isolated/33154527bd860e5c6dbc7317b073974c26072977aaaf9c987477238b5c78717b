     * Called when timed-out waiting for confirmation of the data-path setup (i.e.
     * onDataPathConfirm). Started on the initiator when executing the request for the data-path
     * and on the responder when received a request for data-path (in both cases only on success
     * - i.e. when we're proceeding with data-path setup).
