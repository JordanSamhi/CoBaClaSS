    * Notify the host application that the Application Cache has reached the
    * maximum size. The client must respond by invoking the
    * {@link WebStorage.QuotaUpdater#updateQuota(long) updateQuota(long)}
    * method of the supplied {@link WebStorage.QuotaUpdater} instance. The
    * minimum value that can be set for the new quota is the current quota. The
    * default implementation responds with the current quota, so the quota will
    * not be increased.
    * @param requiredStorage The amount of storage required by the Application
    *                        Cache operation that triggered this notification,
    *                        in bytes.
    * @param quota the current maximum Application Cache size, in bytes
    * @param quotaUpdater An instance of {@link WebStorage.QuotaUpdater} which
    *                     must be used to inform the WebView of the new quota.
    * @deprecated This method is no longer called; WebView now uses the HTML5 / JavaScript Quota
    *             Management API.
