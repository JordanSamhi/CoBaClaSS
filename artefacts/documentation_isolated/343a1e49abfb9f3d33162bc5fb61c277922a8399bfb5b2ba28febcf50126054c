         * <p>
         * This method requires hardware support. Hardware support can be determined using
         * {@link WifiManager.SoftApCallback#onCapabilityChanged(SoftApCapability)} and
         * {@link SoftApCapability#areFeaturesSupported(int)}
         * with {@link SoftApCapability.SOFTAP_FEATURE_CLIENT_FORCE_DISCONNECT}
         *
         * <p>
         * If the method is called on a device without hardware support then starting the soft AP
         * using {@link WifiManager#startTetheredHotspot(SoftApConfiguration)} will fail with
         * {@link WifiManager#SAP_START_FAILURE_UNSUPPORTED_CONFIGURATION}.
         *
         * @param blockedClientList list of clients which are not allowed to associate to the AP.
         * @return Builder for chaining.
