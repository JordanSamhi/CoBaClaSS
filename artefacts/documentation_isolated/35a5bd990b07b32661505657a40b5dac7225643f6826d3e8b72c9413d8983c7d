     * <p> The function call immediately returns after sending a persistent group removal request
     * to the framework. The application is notified of a success or failure to initiate
     * group removal through listener callbacks {@link ActionListener#onSuccess} or
     * {@link ActionListener#onFailure}.
     *
     * <p>The persistent p2p group list stored in the system can be obtained by
     * {@link #requestPersistentGroupInfo(Channel, PersistentGroupInfoListener)} and
     *  a network id can be obtained by {@link WifiP2pGroup#getNetworkId()}.
     *
     * @param c is the channel created at {@link #initialize}
     * @param netId the network id of the p2p group.
     * @param listener for callbacks on success or failure. Can be null.
