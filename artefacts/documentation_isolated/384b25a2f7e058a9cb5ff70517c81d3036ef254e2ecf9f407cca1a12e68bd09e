     * Attempts to move a task backwards in z-order (the order of activities within the task is
     * unchanged).
     *
     * There are several possible results of this call:
     * - if the task is locked, then we will show the lock toast
     * - if there is a task behind the provided task, then that task is made visible and resumed as
     *   this task is moved to the back
     * - otherwise, if there are no other tasks in the stack:
     *     - if this task is in the pinned stack, then we remove the stack completely, which will
     *       have the effect of moving the task to the top or bottom of the fullscreen stack
     *       (depending on whether it is visible)
     *     - otherwise, we simply return home and hide this task
     *
     * @param token A reference to the activity we wish to move
     * @param nonRoot If false then this only works if the activity is the root
     *                of a task; if true it will work for any activity in a task.
     * @return Returns true if the move completed, false if not.
