     * This is called onResume. If an Activity is resuming and the transitions
     * haven't started yet, force the views to appear. This is likely to be
     * caused by the top Activity finishing before the transitions started.
     * In that case, we can finish any transition that was started, but we
     * should cancel any pending transition and just bring those Views visible.
