     * Logs the end of a PNO scan. This is attributed to the current device mobility state, as
     * logged by {@link #enterDeviceMobilityState(int)}. Thus, if the mobility state changes during
     * a PNO scan, one should call {@link #logPnoScanStop()}, {@link #enterDeviceMobilityState(int)}
     * , then {@link #logPnoScanStart()} so that the portion of PNO scan before the mobility state
     * change can be correctly attributed to the previous mobility state.
