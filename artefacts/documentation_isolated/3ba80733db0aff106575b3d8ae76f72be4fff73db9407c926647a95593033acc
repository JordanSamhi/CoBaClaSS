     * Call to re-create the Loader associated with a particular ID.  If there
     * is currently a Loader associated with this ID, it will be
     * canceled/stopped/destroyed as appropriate.  A new Loader with the given
     * arguments will be created and its data delivered to you once available.
     * 
     * <p>This function does some throttling of Loaders.  If too many Loaders
     * have been created for the given ID but not yet generated their data,
     * new calls to this function will create and return a new Loader but not
     * actually start it until some previous loaders have completed.
     * 
     * <p>After calling this function, any previous Loaders associated with
     * this ID will be considered invalid, and you will receive no further
     * data updates from them.
     * 
     * @param id A unique (to this LoaderManager instance) identifier under
     * which to manage the new Loader.
     * @param args Optional arguments that will be propagated to
     * {@link LoaderCallbacks#onCreateLoader(int, Bundle) LoaderCallbacks.onCreateLoader()}.
     * @param callback Interface implementing management of this Loader.  Required.
     * Its onCreateLoader() method will be called while inside of the function to
     * instantiate the Loader object.
