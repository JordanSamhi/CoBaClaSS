     * The search first looks for a child element that matches the selector
     * you provided, then looks for the content-description in its children elements.
     * If both search conditions are fulfilled, the method returns a {@ link UiObject}
     * representing the element matching the selector (not the child element in its
     * subhierarchy containing the content-description).
