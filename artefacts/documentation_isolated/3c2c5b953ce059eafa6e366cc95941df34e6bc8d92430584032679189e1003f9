         * Obtains {@link SeekPoint SeekPoints} for the specified seek time in microseconds.
         *
         * <p>{@code getSeekPoints(timeMicros).first} contains the latest seek point for samples
         * with timestamp equal to or smaller than {@code timeMicros}.
         *
         * <p>{@code getSeekPoints(timeMicros).second} contains the earliest seek point for samples
         * with timestamp equal to or greater than {@code timeMicros}. If a seek point exists for
         * {@code timeMicros}, the returned pair will contain the same {@link SeekPoint} twice.
         *
         * @param timeMicros A seek time in microseconds.
         * @return The corresponding {@link SeekPoint SeekPoints}.
