         * Called when a controller is created for this session. Return allowed commands for
         * controller. By default it returns {@code null}.
         * <p>
         * You can reject the connection by returning {@code null}. In that case, controller
         * receives {@link MediaController2.ControllerCallback#onDisconnected(MediaController2)}
         * and cannot be used.
         * <p>
         * The controller hasn't connected yet in this method, so calls to the controller
         * (e.g. {@link #sendSessionCommand}) would be ignored. Override {@link #onPostConnect} for
         * the custom initialization for the controller instead.
         *
         * @param session the session for this event
         * @param controller controller information.
         * @return allowed commands. Can be {@code null} to reject connection.
