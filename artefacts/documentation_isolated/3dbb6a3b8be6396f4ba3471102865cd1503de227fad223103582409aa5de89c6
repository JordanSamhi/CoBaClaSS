         * Called when a view created by this adapter has been recycled.
         *
         * <p>A view is recycled when a {@link LayoutManager} decides that it no longer
         * needs to be attached to its parent {@link RecyclerView}. This can be because it has
         * fallen out of visibility or a set of cached views represented by views still
         * attached to the parent RecyclerView. If an item view has large or expensive data
         * bound to it such as large bitmaps, this may be a good place to release those
         * resources.</p>
         * <p>
         * RecyclerView calls this method right before clearing ViewHolder's internal data and
         * sending it to RecycledViewPool. This way, if ViewHolder was holding valid information
         * before being recycled, you can call {@link ViewHolder#getAdapterPosition()} to get
         * its adapter position.
         *
         * @param holder The ViewHolder for the view being recycled
