     * Enable Wi-Fi RTT responder mode on the device. The enabling result will be delivered via
     * {@code callback}.
     * <p>
     * Note calling this method with the same callback when the responder is already enabled won't
     * change the responder state, a cached {@link ResponderConfig} from the last enabling will be
     * returned through the callback.
     * <p>
     * This method is deprecated and will throw an {@link UnsupportedOperationException}
     * exception. Please use the {@link WifiRttManager} API to perform a Wi-Fi Aware peer-to-peer
     * ranging.
     *
     * @param callback Callback for responder enabling/disabling result.
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException If {@code callback} is null.
