     * Check if domain is either the same or a sub-domain of any of the domains in the
     * domain tree in this matcher, i.e. all or a sub-set of the labels in domain matches
     * a path in the tree.
     *
     * This will have precedence for matching primary domain over secondary domain if both
     * are found.
     *
     * For example, with primary domain set to "test.google.com" and secondary domain set to
     * "google.com":
     * "test2.test.google.com" -> Match.Primary
     * "test1.google.com" -> Match.Secondary
     *
     * @param domainName Domain name to be checked.
     * @return The match status
