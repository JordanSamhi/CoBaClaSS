     * Get the helper from the registry if it exists, or create and put one into the registry if it
     * does not exist.
     *
     * <p>Since helpers are singleton-like, the context passed to the creator is always the
     * application context so it doesn't leak local contexts pass their lifecycles.
     *
     * @param context The context to create the helper with. This can be any context as this method
     *     will call {@link Context#getApplicationContext()} to ensure the application context is
     *     used.
     * @param cls The helper class.
     * @param creator The method to create the helper. Typically if the helper has a constructor
     *     that takes a context, this creator will be {@code MyHelper::new}.
     * @param <H> The helper class.
     * @return The helper in the registry, either existing or newly registered.
