     * Unlock the lens, allowing it to move again. Typically used after taking a picture.
     *
     * <p>After calling this function, submit the new requestBuilder as a separate capture.
     * Do not submit it as a repeating request or the AF lock will be repeated every time.</p>
     *
     * <p>Create a new repeating request from repeatingBuilder and set that as the updated
     * repeating request.</p>
     *
     * <p>Once the unlock takes effect, {@link AutoFocusStateListener#onAutoFocusInactive} is
     * invoked, and after that the effects depend on which mode you were in:
     * <ul>
     * <li>Passive - Scanning restarts with {@link AutoFocusStateListener#onAutoFocusScan}</li>
     * <li>Active - The lens goes back to a default position (no callbacks)</li>
     * </ul>
     * </p>
     *
     * @param repeatingBuilder Builder for a repeating request.
     * @param requestBuilder Builder for a non-repeating request.
