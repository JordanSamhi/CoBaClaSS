     * Inflate a new hierarchy from the specified XML node. Throws
     * InflaterException if there is an error.
     * <p>
     * <em><strong>Important</strong></em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For performance
     * reasons, inflation relies heavily on pre-processing of XML files
     * that is done at build time. Therefore, it is not currently possible to
     * use inflater with an XmlPullParser over a plain XML file at runtime.
     * 
     * @param parser XML dom node containing the description of the
     *        hierarchy.
     * @param root Optional to be the parent of the generated hierarchy (if
     *        <em>attachToRoot</em> is true), or else simply an object that
     *        provides a set of values for root of the returned
     *        hierarchy (if <em>attachToRoot</em> is false.)
     * @param attachToRoot Whether the inflated hierarchy should be attached to
     *        the root parameter?
     * @return The root of the inflated hierarchy. If root was supplied and
     *         attachToRoot is true, this is root; otherwise it is the root of
     *         the inflated XML file.
