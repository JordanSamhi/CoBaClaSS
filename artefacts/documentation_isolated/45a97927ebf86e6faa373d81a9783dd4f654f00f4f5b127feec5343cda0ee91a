     * addScannedPackageLPw directly modifies the package metadata in  pm.Settings
     * at a point of no-return.  We need to make sure that the scanned package does
     * not contain bad keyset meta-data that could generate an incorrect
     * PackageSetting. Verify that there is a signing keyset, there are no issues
     * with null objects, and the upgrade and defined keysets match.
     *
     * Returns true if the package can safely be added to the keyset metadata.
