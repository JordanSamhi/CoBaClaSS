     * Stop BPF tethering offload stats polling.
     * The data limit cleanup and the tether stats maps cleanup are not implemented here.
     * These cleanups rely on all IpServers calling #tetherOffloadRuleRemove. After the
     * last rule is removed from the upstream, #tetherOffloadRuleRemove does the cleanup
     * functionality.
     * Note that this can be only called on handler thread.
