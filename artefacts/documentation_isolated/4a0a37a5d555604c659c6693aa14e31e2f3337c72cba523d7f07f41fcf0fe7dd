     * Note: It is already known some devices (wrongly) outputs properties with characters
     *       which should not be in the field. One example is "X-GOOGLE TALK". We accept
     *       such kind of input but must never output it unless the target is very specific
     *       to the device which is able to parse the malformed input.
