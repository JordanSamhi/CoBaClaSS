     * The {@link UiSelector} selector of this object must reference a UI element that is editable.
     *
     * When you call this method, the method first simulates a {@link #click()} on
     * editable field to set focus. The method then clears the field's contents
     * and injects your specified text into the field.
     *
     * If you want to capture the original contents of the field, call {@link #getText()} first.
     * You can then modify the text and use this method to update the field.
