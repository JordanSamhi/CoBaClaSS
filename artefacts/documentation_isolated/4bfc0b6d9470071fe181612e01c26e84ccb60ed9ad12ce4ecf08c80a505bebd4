     * Some dial strings in GSM are defined to do non-call setup
     * things, such as modify or query supplementary service settings (eg, call
     * forwarding). These are generally referred to as "MMI codes".
     * We look to see if the dial string contains a valid MMI code (potentially
     * with a dial string at the end as well) and return info here.
     *
     * If the dial string contains no MMI code, we return an instance with
     * only "dialingNumber" set
     *
