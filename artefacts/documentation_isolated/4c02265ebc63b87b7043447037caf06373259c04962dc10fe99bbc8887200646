     * Instead of overriding this method, subclasses should override {@link #onDraw(Canvas)}.
     *
     * The reason for this is that we need the placeholder and progress bar to be drawn over our
     * content. Those two drawables fade out, giving the impression that our content is fading in.
     *
     * Only override this method for custom drawings on top of all the drawable layers.
