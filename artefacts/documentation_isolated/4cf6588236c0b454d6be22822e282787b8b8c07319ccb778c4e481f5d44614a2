     * Method determines whether the Enterprise configuration is insecure. An insecure
     * configuration is one where EAP method requires a CA certification, i.e. PEAP, TLS, or
     * TTLS, and any of the following conditions are met:
     * - Both certificate and CA path are not configured.
     * - Both alternative subject match and domain suffix match are not set.
     *
     * Note: this method does not exhaustively check security of the configuration - i.e. a return
     * value of {@code false} is not a guarantee that the configuration is secure.
