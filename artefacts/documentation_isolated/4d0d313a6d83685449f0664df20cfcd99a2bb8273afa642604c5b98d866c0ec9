     * Attach to the Wi-Fi Aware service - enabling the application to create discovery sessions or
     * create connections to peers. The device will attach to an existing cluster if it can find
     * one or create a new cluster (if it is the first to enable Aware in its vicinity). Results
     * (e.g. successful attach to a cluster) are provided to the {@code attachCallback} object.
     * An application <b>must</b> call {@link WifiAwareSession#close()} when done with the
     * Wi-Fi Aware object.
     * <p>
     * Note: a Aware cluster is a shared resource - if the device is already attached to a cluster
     * then this function will simply indicate success immediately using the same {@code
     * attachCallback}.
     *
     * @param attachCallback A callback for attach events, extended from
     * {@link AttachCallback}.
     * @param handler The Handler on whose thread to execute the callbacks of the {@code
     * attachCallback} object. If a null is provided then the application's main thread will be
     *                used.
