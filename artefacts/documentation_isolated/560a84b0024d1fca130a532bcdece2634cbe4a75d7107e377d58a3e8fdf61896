     * <p>
     * Determine the seinfo value to assign to an apk. The appropriate seinfo value
     * is determined using the following steps:
     * </p>
     * <ul>
     *   <li> All certs used to sign the apk and all certs stored with this policy
     *     instance are tested for set equality. If this fails then null is returned.
     *   </li>
     *   <li> If all certs match then an appropriate inner package stanza is
     *     searched based on package name alone. If matched, the stored seinfo
     *     value for that mapping is returned.
     *   </li>
     *   <li> If all certs matched and no inner package stanza matches then return
     *     the global seinfo value. The returned value can be null in this case.
     *   </li>
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * In all cases, a return value of null should be interpreted as the apk failing
     * to match this Policy instance; i.e. failing this policy stanza.
     * </p>
     * @param pkg the apk to check given as a PackageParser.Package object
     * @return A string representing the seinfo matched during policy lookup.
     *         A value of null can also be returned if no match occured.
