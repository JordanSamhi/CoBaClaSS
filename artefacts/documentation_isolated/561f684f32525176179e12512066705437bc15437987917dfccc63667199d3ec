     * Allows apps to retrieve the MIME type of a URI.
     * If an app is in the same user as the ContentProvider, or if it is allowed to interact across
     * users, then it does not need permission to access the ContentProvider.
     * Either, it needs cross-user uri grants.
     *
     * CTS tests for this functionality can be run with "runtest cts-appsecurity".
     *
     * Test cases are at cts/tests/appsecurity-tests/test-apps/UsePermissionDiffCert/
     *     src/com/android/cts/usespermissiondiffcertapp/AccessPermissionWithDiffSigTest.java
     *
     * @deprecated -- use getProviderMimeTypeAsync.
