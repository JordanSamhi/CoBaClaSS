     * Notify the host application that web content from the specified origin
     * is attempting to use the Geolocation API, but no permission state is
     * currently set for that origin. The host application should invoke the
     * specified callback with the desired permission state. See
     * {@link GeolocationPermissions} for details.
     *
     * <p>Note that for applications targeting Android N and later SDKs
     * (API level > {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#M})
     * this method is only called for requests originating from secure
     * origins such as https. On non-secure origins geolocation requests
     * are automatically denied.
     *
     * @param origin The origin of the web content attempting to use the
     *               Geolocation API.
     * @param callback The callback to use to set the permission state for the
     *                 origin.
