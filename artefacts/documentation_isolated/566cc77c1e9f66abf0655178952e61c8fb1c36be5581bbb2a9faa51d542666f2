         * This method places the window on a given CaptionLayout along with the anchor of the
         * window.
         * <p>
         * According to CEA-708B, the anchor id indicates the gravity of the window as the follows.
         * For example, A value 7 of a anchor id says that a window is align with its parent bottom
         * and is located at the center horizontally of its parent.

         * In order to handle the gravity of a window, there are two steps. First, set the size of
         * the window. Since the window will be positioned at ScaledLayout, the size factors are
         * determined in a ratio. Second, set the gravity of the window. CaptionWindowLayout is
         * inherited from RelativeLayout. Hence, we could set the gravity of its child view,
         * SubtitleView.
         * </p>
         * <p>
         * The gravity of the window is also related to its size. When it should be pushed to a one
         * of the end of the window, like LEFT, RIGHT, TOP or BOTTOM, the anchor point should be a
         * boundary of the window. When it should be pushed in the horizontal/vertical center of its
         * container, the horizontal/vertical center point of the window should be the same as the
         * anchor point.
         * </p>

         * @param captionWindow a given CaptionWindow, which stores the construction info of the
         *                      window.
