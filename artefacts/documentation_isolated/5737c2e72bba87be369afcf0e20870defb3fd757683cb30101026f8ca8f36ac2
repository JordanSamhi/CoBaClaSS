         * Set the resize value when using a {@link android.graphics.Bitmap} as the source.
         * If the bitmap's largest dimension is greater than the value specified, then the bitmap
         * will be resized so that its largest dimension matches {@code maxDimension}. If the
         * bitmap is smaller or equal, the original is used as-is.
         *
         * @deprecated Using {@link #resizeBitmapArea(int)} is preferred since it can handle
         * abnormal aspect ratios more gracefully.
         *
         * @param maxDimension the number of pixels that the max dimension should be scaled down to,
         *                     or any value <= 0 to disable resizing.
