         * Controls whether this is a reference-counted or non-reference-counted WifiLock.
         *
         * Reference-counted WifiLocks keep track of the number of calls to {@link #acquire} and
         * {@link #release}, and only allow the radio to sleep when every call to {@link #acquire}
         * has been balanced with a call to {@link #release}.  Non-reference-counted WifiLocks
         * lock the radio whenever {@link #acquire} is called and it is unlocked, and unlock the
         * radio whenever {@link #release} is called and it is locked.
         *
         * @param refCounted true if this WifiLock should keep a reference count
