     * Enforce one the following conditions are met:
     * (1) The device has a Device Owner, and one of the following holds:
     *   (1.1) The caller is the Device Owner
     *   (1.2) The caller is another app in the same user as the device owner, AND
     *         The caller is the delegated certificate installer.
     * (2) The user has a profile owner, AND:
     *   (2.1) The profile owner has been granted access to Device IDs and one of the following
     *         holds:
     *     (2.1.1) The caller is the profile owner.
     *     (2.1.2) The caller is from another app in the same user as the profile owner, AND
     *       (2.1.2.1) The caller is the delegated cert installer.
     *
     *  For the device owner case, simply check that the caller is the device owner or the
     *  delegated certificate installer.
     *
     *  For the profile owner case, first check that the caller is the profile owner or can
     *  manage the DELEGATION_CERT_INSTALL scope.
     *  If that check succeeds, ensure the profile owner was granted access to device
     *  identifiers. The grant is transitive: The delegated cert installer is implicitly allowed
     *  access to device identifiers in this case as part of the delegation.
