         * Specifies whether the suggestion is created with auto-join enabled or disabled. The
         * user may modify the auto-join configuration of a suggestion directly once the device
         * associates to the network.
         * <p>
         * If auto-join is initialized as disabled the user may still be able to manually connect
         * to the network. Therefore, disabling auto-join only makes sense if
         * {@link #setCredentialSharedWithUser(boolean)} is set to true (the default) which
         * itself implies a secure (non-open) network.
         * <p>
         * If not set, defaults to true (i.e. auto-join is initialized as enabled).
         *
         * @param enabled true for initializing with auto-join enabled (the default), false to
         *                initializing with auto-join disabled.
         * @return Instance of {@link Builder} to enable chaining of the builder method.
