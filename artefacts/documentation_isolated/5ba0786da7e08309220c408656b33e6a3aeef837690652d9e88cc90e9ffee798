     * Register an InterfaceDestroyedListener to the specified iface - returns true on success
     * and false on failure. This listener is in addition to the one registered when the interface
     * was created - allowing non-creators to monitor interface status.
     *
     * @param destroyedListener Listener to call when the allocated interface is removed.
     *                          Will only be registered and used if an interface is created
     *                          successfully.
     * @param handler Handler on which to dispatch listener. Null implies the listener will be
     *                invoked synchronously from the context of the client which triggered the
     *                iface destruction.
