     * Attempt to execute a task corresponding to a previously declared key. If the key is the
     * first expected key, the task will be executed immediately. Otherwise, the task is stored
     * until its key becomes the first expected key. Execution of a task results in the removal
     * of that key, which potentially allows another key to now become the first expected key,
     * and may cause one or more other tasks to be executed.
     * <p/>
     * If the key is not expected, the task will be executed immediately as an edge case.
     *
     * @param key  the key previously declared in {@link #expect(Object, Callback)}.
     * @param task the task to execute or store, depending on its corresponding key.
