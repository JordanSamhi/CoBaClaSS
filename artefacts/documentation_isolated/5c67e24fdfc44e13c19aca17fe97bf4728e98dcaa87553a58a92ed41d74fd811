     * Return the global {@link KeyEvent.DispatcherState KeyEvent.DispatcherState}
     * for this view's window.  Returns null if the view is not currently attached
     * to the window.  Normally you will not need to use this directly, but
     * just use the standard high-level event callbacks like
     * {@link #onKeyDown(int, KeyEvent)}.
