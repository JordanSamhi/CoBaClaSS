     * @return Returns true if the ImsService is ready to take commands, false otherwise. If this
     * method returns false, it doesn't mean that the Binder connection is not available (use
     * {@link #isBinderReady()} to check that), but that the ImsService is not accepting commands
     * at this time.
     *
     * For example, for DSDS devices, only one slot can be {@link ImsFeature#STATE_READY} to take
     * commands at a time, so the other slot must stay at {@link ImsFeature#STATE_UNAVAILABLE}.
