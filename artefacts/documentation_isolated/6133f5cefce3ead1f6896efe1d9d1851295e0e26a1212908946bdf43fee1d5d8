     * Add a service discovery request.
     *
     * <p> The function call immediately returns after sending a request to add service
     * discovery request to the framework. The application is notified of a success or failure to
     * add service through listener callbacks {@link ActionListener#onSuccess} or
     * {@link ActionListener#onFailure}.
     *
     * <p>After service discovery request is added, you can initiate service discovery by
     * {@link #discoverServices}.
     *
     * <p>The added service requests can be cleared with calls to
     * {@link #removeServiceRequest(Channel, WifiP2pServiceRequest, ActionListener)} or
     * {@link #clearServiceRequests(Channel, ActionListener)}.
     *
     * @param c is the channel created at {@link #initialize}
     * @param req is the service discovery request.
     * @param listener for callbacks on success or failure. Can be null.
