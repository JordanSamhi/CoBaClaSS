     * @return true when this object has nothing meaningful for Android's
     *         Contacts, and thus is "ignorable" for Android's Contacts. This
     *         does not mean an original vCard is really empty. Even when the
     *         original vCard has some fields, this may ignore it if those
     *         fields cannot be transcoded into Android's Contacts
     *         representation.
