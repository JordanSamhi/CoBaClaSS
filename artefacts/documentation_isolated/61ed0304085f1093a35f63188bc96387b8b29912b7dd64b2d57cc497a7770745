         * Copies a String's byte representation into the TLV with the indicated
         * type. For an LV formatted structure (i.e. typeLength=0 in
         * {@link TlvConstructor TlvConstructor(int, int)} ) the type field is
         * ignored.
         *
         * @param type The value to be placed into the Type field.
         * @param data The string whose bytes are to be inserted into the
         *            structure.
         * @return The constructor to facilitate chaining
         *         {@code ctr.putXXX(..).putXXX(..)}.
