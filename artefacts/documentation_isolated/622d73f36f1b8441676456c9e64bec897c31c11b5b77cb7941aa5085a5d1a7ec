     * @return The number of successful measurements used to calculate the distance and standard
     * deviation. If the number of successful measurements if 1 then then standard deviation,
     * returned by {@link #getDistanceStdDevMm()}, is not valid (a 0 is returned for the standard
     * deviation).
     * <p>
     * The total number of measurement attempts is returned by
     * {@link #getNumAttemptedMeasurements()}. The number of successful measurements will be at
     * most 1 less then the number of attempted measurements.
     * <p>
     * Only valid if {@link #getStatus()} returns {@link #STATUS_SUCCESS}, otherwise will throw an
     * exception.
