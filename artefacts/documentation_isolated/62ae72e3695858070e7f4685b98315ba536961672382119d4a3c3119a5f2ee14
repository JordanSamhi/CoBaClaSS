     * Retrieves a list of all the saved hidden networks for scans
     *
     * Hidden network list sent to the firmware has limited size. If there are a lot of saved
     * networks, this list will be truncated and we might end up not sending the networks
     * with the highest chance of connecting to the firmware.
     * So, re-sort the network list based on the frequency of connection to those networks
     * and whether it was last seen in the scan results.
     *
     * @return list of networks in the order of priority.
