     * Destroy the Wi-Fi Aware service session and, if no other applications are attached to Aware,
     * also disable Aware. This method destroys all outstanding operations - i.e. all publish and
     * subscribes are terminated, and any outstanding data-links are shut-down. However, it is
     * good practice to destroy these discovery sessions and connections explicitly before a
     * session-wide destroy.
     * <p>
     * An application may re-attach after a destroy using
     * {@link WifiAwareManager#attach(AttachCallback, Handler)} .
