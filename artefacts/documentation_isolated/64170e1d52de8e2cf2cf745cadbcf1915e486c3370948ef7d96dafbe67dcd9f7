     * Initiates setting up a data-path between device and peer. Security is provided by either
     * PMK or Passphrase (not both) - if both are null then an open (unencrypted) link is set up.
     *
     * @param transactionId      Transaction ID for the transaction - used in the async callback to
     *                           match with the original request.
     * @param peerId             ID of the peer ID to associate the data path with. A value of 0
     *                           indicates that not associated with an existing session.
     * @param channelRequestType Indicates whether the specified channel is available, if available
     *                           requested or forced (resulting in failure if cannot be
     *                           accommodated).
     * @param channel            The channel on which to set up the data-path.
     * @param peer               The MAC address of the peer to create a connection with.
     * @param interfaceName      The interface on which to create the data connection.
     * @param pmk Pairwise master key (PMK - see IEEE 802.11i) for the data-path.
     * @param passphrase  Passphrase for the data-path.
     * @param isOutOfBand Is the data-path out-of-band (i.e. without a corresponding Aware discovery
     *                    session).
     * @param appInfo Arbitrary binary blob transmitted to the peer.
     * @param capabilities The capabilities of the firmware.
