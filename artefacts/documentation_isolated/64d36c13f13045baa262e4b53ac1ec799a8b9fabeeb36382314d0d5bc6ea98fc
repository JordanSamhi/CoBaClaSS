     * Show or hide network provisioning notifications.
     *
     * We use notifications for two purposes: to notify that a network requires sign in
     * (NotificationType.SIGN_IN), or to notify that a network does not have Internet access
     * (NotificationType.NO_INTERNET). We display at most one notification per ID, so on a
     * particular network we can display the notification type that was most recently requested.
     * So for example if a captive portal fails to reply within a few seconds of connecting, we
     * might first display NO_INTERNET, and then when the captive portal check completes, display
     * SIGN_IN.
     *
     * @param id an identifier that uniquely identifies this notification.  This must match
     *         between show and hide calls.  We use the NetID value but for legacy callers
     *         we concatenate the range of types with the range of NetIDs.
     * @param notifyType the type of the notification.
     * @param nai the network with which the notification is associated. For a SIGN_IN, NO_INTERNET,
     *         or LOST_INTERNET notification, this is the network we're connecting to. For a
     *         NETWORK_SWITCH notification it's the network that we switched from. When this network
     *         disconnects the notification is removed.
     * @param switchToNai for a NETWORK_SWITCH notification, the network we are switching to. Null
     *         in all other cases. Only used to determine the text of the notification.
