     * This method returns filtered list of SubscriptionInfo from {@link #getSubscriptionInfo}.
     * above. Maybe empty but never null.
     *
     * In DSDS mode if both subscriptions are grouped and one is opportunistic, we filter out one
     * of them based on carrier config. e.g. In this case we should only show one carrier name
     * on the status bar and quick settings.
