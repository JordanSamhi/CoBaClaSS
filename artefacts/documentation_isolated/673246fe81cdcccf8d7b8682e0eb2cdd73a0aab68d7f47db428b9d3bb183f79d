     * Sets whether this provider is currently allowed or not. Note that this is specific to the
     * provider only, and is not related to global location settings. This is a hint to the Location
     * Manager that this provider will generally be unable to fulfill incoming requests. This
     * provider may still receive callbacks to onSetRequest while not allowed, and must decide
     * whether to attempt to satisfy those requests or not.
     *
     * <p>Some guidelines: providers should set their own allowed/disallowed status based only on
     * state "owned" by that provider. For instance, providers should not take into account the
     * state of the location master setting when setting themselves allowed or disallowed, as this
     * state is not owned by a particular provider. If a provider requires some additional user
     * consent that is particular to the provider, this should be use to set the allowed/disallowed
     * state. If the provider proxies to another provider, the child provider's allowed/disallowed
     * state should be taken into account in the parent's allowed state. For most providers, it is
     * expected that they will be always allowed.
