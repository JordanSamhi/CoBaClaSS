     * Notify PhoneSwitcher to try to switch data to an opportunistic subscription.
     *
     * Set opportunistic data subscription. It's an indication to switch Internet data to this
     * subscription. It has to be an active subscription, and PhoneSwitcher will try to validate
     * it first if needed. If subId is DEFAULT_SUBSCRIPTION_ID, it means we are un-setting
     * opportunistic data sub and switch data back to primary sub.
     *
     * @param subId the opportunistic data subscription to switch to. pass DEFAULT_SUBSCRIPTION_ID
     *              if un-setting it.
     * @param needValidation whether Telephony will wait until the network is validated by
     *              connectivity service before switching data to it. More details see
     *              {@link NetworkCapabilities#NET_CAPABILITY_VALIDATED}.
     * @param callback Callback will be triggered once it succeeds or failed.
     *                 Pass null if don't care about the result.
