         * Removes a reference to this resource. If the resultant reference count is zero, the
         * underlying resources are freed, and references to all child resources are also dropped
         * recursively (resulting in them freeing their resources and children, etcetera)
         *
         * <p>This method also sets the reference count to an invalid value (-1) to signify that it
         * has been fully released. Any subsequent calls to this method will result in an
         * IllegalStateException being thrown due to resource already having been previously
         * released
