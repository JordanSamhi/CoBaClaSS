     * Attempt to return whether the requested index is within the size of the wrapped input
     * stream. One side effect is {@link #fill(int)} will be called.
     *
     * <p/>
     * If this method returns true, it is guaranteed that {@link #get(int)} with the same index
     * will not fail. That means that if the requested index is within the size of the wrapped
     * input stream, but the index is less than the head of the internal buffer,
     * a runtime exception is thrown.
     *
     * <p/>
     * See {@link #get(int)} for caveats. A lot of the same warnings about exceptions and
     * <code>advanceTo()</code> apply.
     * @param index The requested index.
     * @return True if requested index is within the size of the wrapped input stream. False if
     * the index is beyond the size.
