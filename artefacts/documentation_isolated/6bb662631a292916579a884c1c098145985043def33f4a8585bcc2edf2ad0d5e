     * immediate, which is why this setting is needed. Once the next key is created, it can take up
     * to 72 hours potentially (or longer if the user has no network) for the next key to be synced
     * with the keystore. Only after that has happened does the client attempt to re-wrap all
     * tertiary keys and commit the rotation.
