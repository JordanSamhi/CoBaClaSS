     * Reports that a compatibility change is affecting the current process now.
     *
     * <p>Calls to this method from a non-app process are ignored. This allows code implementing
     * APIs that are used by apps and by other code (e.g. the system server) to report changes
     * regardless of the process it's running in. When called in a non-app process, this method is
     * a no-op.
     *
     * <p>Note: for changes that are gated using {@link #isChangeEnabled(long)}, you do not need to
     * call this API directly. The change will be reported for you in the case that
     * {@link #isChangeEnabled(long)} returns {@code true}.
     *
     * @param changeId The ID of the compatibility change taking effect.
