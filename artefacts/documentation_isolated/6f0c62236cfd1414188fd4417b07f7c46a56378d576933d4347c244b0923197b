     * Mode"), which is a feature where the device goes into a special
     * state for a short period of time after making an outgoing emergency
     * call.
     *
     * (On current devices, that state lasts 5 minutes.  It prevents data
     * usage by other apps, to avoid conflicts with any possible incoming
     * calls.  It also puts up a notification in the status bar, showing a
     * countdown while ECM is active, and allowing the user to exit ECM.)
     *
     * Currently this is assumed to be true for CDMA phones, and false
     * otherwise.
