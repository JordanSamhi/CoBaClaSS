     * Create a new password based SP blob based on the supplied authentication token, such that
     * a future successful authentication with unwrapPasswordBasedSyntheticPassword() would result
     * in the same authentication token.
     *
     * This method only creates SP blob wrapping around the given synthetic password and does not
     * handle logic around SID or SP handle. The caller should separately ensure that the user's SID
     * is consistent with the device state by calling other APIs in this class.
     *
     * @see #newSidForUser
     * @see #clearSidForUser
     * @return a new password handle for the wrapped SP blob
     * @throw IllegalStateException if creation fails.
