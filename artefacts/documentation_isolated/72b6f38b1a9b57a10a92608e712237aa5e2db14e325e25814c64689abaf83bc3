     * Set exempted downstream type. If there is only exempted downstream type active,
     * corresponding entitlement check will not be run and cellular upstream will be permitted
     * by default. If a privileged app enables tethering without a provisioning check, and then
     * another app enables tethering of the same type but does not disable the provisioning check,
     * then the downstream immediately loses exempt status and a provisioning check is run.
     * If any non-exempted downstream type is active, the cellular upstream will be gated by the
     * result of entitlement check from non-exempted downstreams. If entitlement check is still
     * in progress on non-exempt downstreams, ceullar upstream would default be disabled. When any
     * non-exempted downstream gets positive entitlement result, ceullar upstream will be enabled.
