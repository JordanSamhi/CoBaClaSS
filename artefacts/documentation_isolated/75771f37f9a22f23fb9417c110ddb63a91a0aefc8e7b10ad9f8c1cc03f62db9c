     * Low-level function for instantiating by name. This attempts to
     * instantiate class of the given <var>name</var> found in this
     * inflater's ClassLoader.
     * 
     * <p>
     * There are two things that can happen in an error case: either the
     * exception describing the error will be thrown, or a null will be
     * returned. You must deal with both possibilities -- the former will happen
     * the first time createItem() is called for a class of a particular name,
     * the latter every time there-after for that class name.
     * 
     * @param name The full name of the class to be instantiated.
     * @param attrs The XML attributes supplied for this instance.
     * 
     * @return The newly instantied item, or null.
