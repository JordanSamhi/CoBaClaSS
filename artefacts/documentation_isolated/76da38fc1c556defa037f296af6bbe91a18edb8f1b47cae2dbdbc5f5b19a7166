     * Create a {@link TransportClientManager} such that {@link #getTransportClient(ComponentName,
     * Bundle, String)} returns a {@link TransportClient} which connects to an intermediate {@link
     * IBackupTransport} that encrypts (or decrypts) the data when sending it (or receiving it) from
     * the {@link IBackupTransport} for the given {@link ComponentName}.
