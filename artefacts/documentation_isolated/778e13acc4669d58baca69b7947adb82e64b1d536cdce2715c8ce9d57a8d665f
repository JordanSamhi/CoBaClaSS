     * Filters incoming pause and resume requests based on whether there are other active pause or
     * resume requests at the current time.

     * Requests to pause the video stream using the {@link VideoProfile#STATE_PAUSED} bit can come
     * from both the {@link android.telecom.InCallService}, as well as via the
     * {@link #pauseVideo(int, int)} and {@link #resumeVideo(int, int)} methods.  As a result,
     * multiple sources can potentially pause or resume the video stream.  This method ensures that
     * providing any one request source has paused the video that the video will remain paused.
     *
     * @param fromProfile The request's from {@link VideoProfile}.
     * @param toProfile The request's to {@link VideoProfile}.
     * @param source The source of the request, as identified by a {@code VideoPauseTracker#SOURCE*}
     *               constant.
     * @return The new toProfile, with the pause bit set or unset based on whether we should
     *      actually pause or resume the video at the current time.
