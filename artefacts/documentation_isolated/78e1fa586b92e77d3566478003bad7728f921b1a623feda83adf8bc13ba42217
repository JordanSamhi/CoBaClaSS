     * Link the snapshot to a Bitmap_Delegate.
     * <p/>
     * This is only for the case where the snapshot was created with a null image when calling
     * {@link #createDefaultSnapshot(Bitmap_Delegate)}, and is therefore not yet linked to
     * a previous snapshot.
     * <p/>
     * If any transform or clip information was set before, they are put into the Graphics object.
     * @param bitmap the bitmap to link to.
