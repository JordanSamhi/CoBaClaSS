     * Adds |newData| to the ring buffer. Removes existing entries to make room, if necessary.
     * Existing entries are removed in FIFO order.
     * <p><b>Note:</b> will fail if |newData| itself exceeds the size limit for this buffer.
     * Will first remove all existing entries in this case. (This guarantees that the ring buffer
     * always represents a contiguous sequence of data.)
     * @param newData data to be added to the ring
     * @return true if the data was added
