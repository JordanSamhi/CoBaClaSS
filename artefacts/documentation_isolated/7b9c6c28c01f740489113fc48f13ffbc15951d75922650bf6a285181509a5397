     * Retrieves the set of disabled changes for a given app. Any change ID not in the returned
     * array is by default enabled for the app.
     *
     * @param appInfo The app in question
     * @return A sorted long array of change IDs. We use a primitive array to minimize memory
     * footprint: Every app process will store this array statically so we aim to reduce
     * overhead as much as possible.
