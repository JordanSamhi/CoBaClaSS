     * Returns if the FontFamily should contain any fonts. If this returns true and
     * {@link #getFont(int, boolean)} returns an empty list, it means that an error occurred while
     * loading the fonts. However, some fonts are deliberately skipped, for example they are not
     * bundled with the SDK. In such a case, this method returns false.
