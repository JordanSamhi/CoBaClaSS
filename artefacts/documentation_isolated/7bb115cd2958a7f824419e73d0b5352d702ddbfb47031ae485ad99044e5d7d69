     * Generates a two-pointer gesture with arbitrary starting and ending points.
     *
     * @param startPoint1 start point of pointer 1
     * @param startPoint2 start point of pointer 2
     * @param endPoint1 end point of pointer 1
     * @param endPoint2 end point of pointer 2
     * @param steps the number of steps for the gesture. Steps are injected 
     * about 5 milliseconds apart, so 100 steps may take around 0.5 seconds to complete.
     * @return <code>true</code> if all touch events for this gesture are injected successfully,
     *         <code>false</code> otherwise
     * @since API Level 18
