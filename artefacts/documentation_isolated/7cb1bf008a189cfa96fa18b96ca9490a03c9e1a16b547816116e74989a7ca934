     * {@link CallTracker#convertNumberIfNecessary(Phone, String)} can be used to convert a dialed
     * number to another number based on carrier config.  This is used where a carrier wishes to
     * redirect certain short codes such as *55 to another number (e.g. a 1-800 service number).
     * The {@link CallTracker} sub-classes call
     * {@link CallTracker#convertNumberIfNecessary(Phone, String)} to retrieve the newly converted
     * number and instantiate the {@link Connection} instance using the converted number so that the
     * system will dial out the substitution number instead of the originally dialed one.  This gem
     * of a method is called after the dialing process to restore the originally dialed number and
     * keep track of the fact that a converted number was used to place the call.
     * @param oriNumber The original number prior to conversion.
