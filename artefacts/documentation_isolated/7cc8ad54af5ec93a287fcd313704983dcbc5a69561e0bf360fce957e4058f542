     * Registers a promoter with the pipeline. Promoters are able to promote child notifications to
     * top-level, i.e. move a notification that would be a child of a group and make it appear
     * ungrouped. Promoters are called on each child notification in the order that they are
     * registered. If any promoter returns true, the notification is removed from the group (and no
     * other promoters are called on it).
