     * Register a ManagerStatusListener to get information about the status of the manager. Use the
     * isReady() and isStarted() methods to check status immediately after registration and when
     * triggered.
     *
     * It is safe to re-register the same callback object - duplicates are detected and only a
     * single copy kept.
     *
     * @param listener ManagerStatusListener listener object.
     * @param handler Handler on which to dispatch listener. Null implies the listener will be
     *                invoked synchronously from the context of the client which triggered the
     *                state change.
