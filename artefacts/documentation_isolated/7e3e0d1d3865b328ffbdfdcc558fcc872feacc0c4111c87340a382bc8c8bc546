     *
     * <p>This is the effective (real) crop that is applied by the camera api1 device
     * when projecting the zoom onto the intermediate preview buffer. Use this when
     * deciding which zoom ratio to apply.</p>
     *
     * <p>When zoom is supported, this will return a list of {@code 1 + #getMaxZoom} size,
     * where each crop rectangle corresponds to a zoom ratio (and is centered at the middle).</p>
     *
     * <p>Each crop rectangle is changed to have the same aspect ratio as {@code streamSize},
     * by shrinking the rectangle if necessary.</p>
     *
     * <p>To get the reported crop region when applying a zoom to the sensor, use {@code streamSize}
     * = {@code activeArray size}.</p>
