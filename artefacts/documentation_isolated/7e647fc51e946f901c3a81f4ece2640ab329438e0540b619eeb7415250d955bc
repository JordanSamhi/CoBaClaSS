     * Return true if the current phone supports Over The Air Service
     * Provisioning (OTASP)
     *
     * Currently this is assumed to be true for CDMA phones, and false
     * otherwise.
     *
     * TODO: Watch out: this is also highly carrier-specific, since the
     * OTASP procedure is different from one carrier to the next, *and* the
     * different carriers may want very different onscreen UI as well.
     * The procedure may even be different for different devices with the
     * same carrier.
     *
     * So we eventually will need a much more flexible, pluggable design.
     * This method here is just a placeholder to reduce hardcoded
     * "if (CDMA)" checks sprinkled throughout the phone app.
