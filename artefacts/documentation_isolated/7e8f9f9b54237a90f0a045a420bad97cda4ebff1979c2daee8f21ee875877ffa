     * Get record size for a linear fixed EF
     *
     * @param fileid EF id
     * @param onLoaded ((AsnyncResult)(onLoaded.obj)).result is the recordSize[]. recordSize[0] is
     *                 the single record length, recordSize[1] is the total length of the EF file
     *                 and recordSize[2] is the number of records in the EF file. So recordSize[0]
     *                 * recordSize[2] = recordSize[1].
