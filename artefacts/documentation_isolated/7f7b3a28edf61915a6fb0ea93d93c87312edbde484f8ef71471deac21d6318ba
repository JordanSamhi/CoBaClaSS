   * Get a {@link Mixin} from this template registered earlier in {@link #registerMixin(Class,
   * Mixin)}.
   *
   * @param cls The class marker of Mixin being requested. The actual Mixin returned may be a
   *     subclass of this marker. Note that this must be the same class as registered in {@link
   *     #registerMixin(Class, Mixin)}, which is not necessarily the same as the concrete class of
   *     the instance returned by this method.
   * @param <M> The type of the class marker.
   * @return The mixin marked by {@code cls}, or null if the template does not have a matching
   *     mixin.
