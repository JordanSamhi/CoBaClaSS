         * Listener for camera service death.
         *
         * <p>The camera service isn't supposed to die under any normal circumstances, but can be
         * turned off during debug, or crash due to bugs.  So detect that and null out the interface
         * object, so that the next calls to the manager can try to reconnect.</p>
