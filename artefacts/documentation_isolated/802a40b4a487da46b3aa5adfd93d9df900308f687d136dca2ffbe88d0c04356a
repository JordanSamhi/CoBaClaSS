     * Throws an {@link IOException} with a message based on {@link #getMessage()} and with this
     * instance as the cause.
     *
     * <p>This method always terminates by throwing the exception. Callers can write
     * {@code throw e.rethrowAsIOException()} to make that clear to the compiler.
