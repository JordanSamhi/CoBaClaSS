     * Sets the RTP payload type for dual-tone multi-frequency (DTMF) digits.
     * The primary usage is to send digits to the remote gateway to perform
     * certain tasks, such as second-stage dialing. According to RFC 2833, the
     * RTP payload type for DTMF is assigned dynamically, so it must be in the
     * range of 96 and 127. One can use {@code -1} to disable DTMF and free up
     * the previous assigned type. This method cannot be called when the stream
     * already joined an {@link AudioGroup}.
     *
     * @param type The RTP payload type to be used or {@code -1} to disable it.
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if the type is invalid or used by codec.
     * @throws IllegalStateException if the stream is busy.
     * @see AudioGroup#sendDtmf(int)
