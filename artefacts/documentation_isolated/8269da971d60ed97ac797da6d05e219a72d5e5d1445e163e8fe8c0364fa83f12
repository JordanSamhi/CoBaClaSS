     * Register a listener to be called when an interface of the specified type could be requested.
     * No guarantees are provided (some other entity could request it first). The listener is
     * active from registration until either
     * <li>unregistration (using
     * {@link #unregisterInterfaceAvailableForRequestListener(int,
     * InterfaceAvailableForRequestListener)})</li>
     * <li>HAL stop (using {@link #stop()}.</li>
     *
     * Only a single instance of a listener will be registered (even if the specified looper is
     * different).
     *
     * Note that if it is possible to create the specified interface type at registration time
     * then the callback will be triggered immediately.
     *
     * @param ifaceType The interface type (IfaceType) to be monitored.
     * @param listener Listener to call when an interface of the requested
     *                 type could be created
     * @param handler Handler on which to dispatch listener. Null implies the listener will be
     *                invoked synchronously from the context of the client which triggered the
     *                mode change.
