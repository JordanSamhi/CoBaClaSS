         * ONEWAY binder call to cancel the inbound authorization request.
         * <p>
         * This is a oneway call, and so is authorizeReport, so the
         * caller's ordering is preserved.  The other calls on this object are synchronous, so
         * their ordering is not guaranteed with respect to these calls.  So the implementation
         * sends out extra broadcasts to allow for eventual consistency.
