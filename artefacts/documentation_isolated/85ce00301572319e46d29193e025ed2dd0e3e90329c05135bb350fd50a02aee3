     * Sends a probe request to the AP and waits for a response in order to determine whether
     * there is connectivity between the device and AP.
     *
     * @param ifaceName Name of the interface.
     * @param receiverMac the MAC address of the AP that the probe request will be sent to.
     * @param callback callback triggered when the probe was ACKed by the AP, or when
     *                an error occurs after the link probe was started.
     * @param mcs The MCS index that this probe will be sent at. If mcs < 0, the driver will select
     *            the rate automatically. If the device does not support sending the frame at a
     *            specified MCS rate, the transmission will be aborted and
     *            {@link WifiNl80211Manager.SendMgmtFrameCallback#onFailure(int)} will be called
     *            with reason {@link WifiNl80211Manager#SEND_MGMT_FRAME_ERROR_MCS_UNSUPPORTED}.
