     * Figure out a reasonable flex time for cases where none is provided (old api calls).
     * @param syncTimeSeconds requested sync time from now.
     * @return amount of seconds before syncTimeSeconds that the sync can occur.
     *      I.e.
     *      earliest_sync_time = syncTimeSeconds - calculateDefaultFlexTime(syncTimeSeconds)
     * The flex time is capped at a percentage of the {@link #DEFAULT_POLL_FREQUENCY_SECONDS}.
