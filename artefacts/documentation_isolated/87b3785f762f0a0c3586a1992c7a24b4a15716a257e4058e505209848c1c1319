     * This call must be preceded by a corresponding call to
     * {@link #beginSection(String)}. Calling this method will mark the end of
     * the most recently begun section of code, so care must be taken to ensure
     * that beginSection / endSection pairs are properly nested and called from
     * the same thread.
