     * Starts a local-only hotspot with a specific configuration applied. See
     * {@link #startLocalOnlyHotspot(LocalOnlyHotspotCallback, Handler)}.
     *
     * Applications need either {@link android.Manifest.permission#NETWORK_SETUP_WIZARD} or
     * {@link android.Manifest.permission#NETWORK_SETTINGS} to call this method.
     *
     * Since custom configuration settings may be incompatible with each other, the hotspot started
     * through this method cannot coexist with another hotspot created through
     * startLocalOnlyHotspot. If this is attempted, the first hotspot request wins and others
     * receive {@link LocalOnlyHotspotCallback#ERROR_GENERIC} through
     * {@link LocalOnlyHotspotCallback#onFailed}.
     *
     * @param config Custom configuration for the hotspot. See {@link SoftApConfiguration}.
     * @param executor Executor to run callback methods on, or null to use the main thread.
     * @param callback Callback object for updates about hotspot status, or null for no updates.
