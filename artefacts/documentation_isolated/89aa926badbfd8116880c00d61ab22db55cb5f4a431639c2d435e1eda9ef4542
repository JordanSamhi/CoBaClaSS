     * Add or update a Passpoint configuration.  The configuration provides a credential
     * for connecting to Passpoint networks that are operated by the Passpoint
     * service provider specified in the configuration.
     *
     * Each configuration is uniquely identified by a unique key which depends on the contents of
     * the configuration. This allows the caller to install multiple profiles with the same FQDN
     * (Fully qualified domain name). Therefore, in order to update an existing profile, it is
     * first required to remove it using {@link WifiManager#removePasspointConfiguration(String)}.
     * Otherwise, a new profile will be added with both configuration.
     *
     * @param config The Passpoint configuration to be added
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if configuration is invalid or Passpoint is not enabled on
     *                                  the device.
     *
     * Deprecated for general app usage - except DO/PO apps.
     * See {@link WifiNetworkSuggestion.Builder#setPasspointConfig(PasspointConfiguration)} to
     * create a passpoint suggestion.
     * See {@link #addNetworkSuggestions(List)}, {@link #removeNetworkSuggestions(List)} for new
     * API to add Wi-Fi networks for consideration when auto-connecting to wifi.
     * <b>Compatibility Note:</b> For applications targeting
     * {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#R} or above, this API will always fail and throw
     * {@link IllegalArgumentException}.
