     * Convenience function for updating settings value as coma separated
     * integer values. This will either create a new entry in the table if the
     * given name does not exist, or modify the value of the existing row
     * with that name.  Note that internally setting values are always
     * stored as strings, so this function converts the given value to a
     * string before storing it.
     *

     * @param name The name of the setting to modify.
     * @param index The index of the list
     * @param value The new value for the setting to be added to the list.
     * @return true if the value was set, false on database errors
     * @hide
