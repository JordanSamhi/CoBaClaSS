 This is used to provide information to drivers to optimize performance depending
     * on the current mode of operation.
     * 0 - disabled
     * 1 - source operation
     * 2 - sink operation
     *
     * As an example, the driver could reduce the channel dwell time during scanning
     * when acting as a source or sink to minimize impact on miracast.
