     * This method adds views as targets to the transition, but only if the transition
     * doesn't already have a target. It is best for views to contain one View object
     * that does not exist in the view hierarchy (state.nonExistentView) so that
     * when they are removed later, a list match will suffice to remove the targets.
     * Otherwise, if you happened to have targeted the exact views for the transition,
     * the replaceTargets call will remove them unexpectedly.
