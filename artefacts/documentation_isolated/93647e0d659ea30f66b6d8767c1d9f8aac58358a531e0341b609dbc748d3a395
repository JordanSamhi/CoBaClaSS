     * Stops user but allow delayed locking. Delayed locking keeps user unlocked even after
     * stopping only if {@code config_multiuserDelayUserDataLocking} overlay is set true.
     *
     * <p>When delayed locking is not enabled through the overlay, this call becomes the same
     * with {@link #stopUser(int, boolean, IStopUserCallback)} call.
     *
     * @param userId User id to stop.
     * @param force Force stop the user even if the user is related with system user or current
     *              user.
     * @param callback Callback called when user has stopped.
     *
     * @return {@link ActivityManager#USER_OP_SUCCESS} when user is stopped successfully. Returns
     *         other {@code ActivityManager#USER_OP_*} codes for failure.
