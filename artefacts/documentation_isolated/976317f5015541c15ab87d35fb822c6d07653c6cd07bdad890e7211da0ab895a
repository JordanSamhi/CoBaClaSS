     * Reports stats for a successful link probe.
     *
     * @param timeSinceLastTxSuccessMs At {@code startTimestampMs}, the number of milliseconds since
     *                                 the last Tx success (according to
     *                                 {@link WifiInfo#txSuccess}).
     * @param rssi The Rx RSSI at {@code startTimestampMs}.
     * @param linkSpeed The Tx link speed in Mbps at {@code startTimestampMs}.
     * @param elapsedTimeMs The number of milliseconds between when the command to transmit the
     *                      probe was sent to the driver and when the driver responded that the
     *                      probe was ACKed. Note: this number should be correlated with the number
     *                      of retries that the driver attempted before the probe was ACKed.
