     * Called to indicate that the APF Program & data buffer must be read asynchronously from the
     * wifi driver.
     *
     * <p>Due to Wifi HAL limitations, the current implementation only supports dumping the entire
     * buffer. In response to this request, the driver returns the data buffer asynchronously
     * by sending an IpClient#EVENT_READ_PACKET_FILTER_COMPLETE message.
