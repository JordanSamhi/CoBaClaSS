     * Convert a IPv4 address from an integer to an InetAddress (0x04030201 -> 1.2.3.4)
     *
     * <p>This method uses the higher-order int bytes as the lower-order IPv4 address bytes,
     * which is an unusual convention. Consider {@link #intToInet4AddressHTH(int)} instead.
     * @param hostAddress an int coding for an IPv4 address, where higher-order int byte is
     *                    lower-order IPv4 address byte
