     *
     * <p><b>Note: </b>the state is associated with the app that was autofilled in the previous
     * {@link AutofillService#onFillRequest(FillRequest, android.os.CancellationSignal, FillCallback)}
     * , which is not necessary the same app being autofilled now.
     *
     * @deprecated use {@link #getEvents()} then {@link Event#getClientState()} instead.
