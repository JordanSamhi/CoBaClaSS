         * This method together with {@link setClientControlByUserEnabled(boolean)} control client
         * connections to the AP. If client control by user is disabled using the above method then
         * this API has no effect and clients are allowed to associate to the AP (within limit of
         * max number of clients).
         *
         * If client control by user is enabled then this API configures the list of clients
         * which are explicitly allowed. These are auto-accepted.
         *
         * All other clients which attempt to associate, whose MAC addresses are on neither list,
         * are:
         * <ul>
         * <li>Rejected</li>
         * <li>A callback {@link WifiManager.SoftApCallback#onBlockedClientConnecting(WifiClient)}
         * is issued (which allows the user to add them to the allowed client list if desired).<li>
         * </ul>
         *
         * @param allowedClientList list of clients which are allowed to associate to the AP
         *                          without user pre-approval.
