     * Returns the Sha-256 fingerprints of all certificates from the specified package as a list of
     * upper case HEX Strings with bytes separated by colons. Given an app {@link
     * android.content.pm.Signature}, the fingerprint can be computed as {@link
     * Utils#computeNormalizedSha256Fingerprint} {@code(signature.toByteArray())}.
     *
     * <p>Given a signed APK, Java 7's commandline keytool can compute the fingerprint using: {@code
     * keytool -list -printcert -jarfile signed_app.apk}
     *
     * <p>Example: "10:39:38:EE:45:37:E5:9E:8E:E7:92:F6:54:50:4F:B8:34:6F:C6:B3:46:D0:BB:C4:41:5F:C3:39:FC:FC:8E:C1"
     *
     * @throws NameNotFoundException if an app with packageName is not installed on the device.
