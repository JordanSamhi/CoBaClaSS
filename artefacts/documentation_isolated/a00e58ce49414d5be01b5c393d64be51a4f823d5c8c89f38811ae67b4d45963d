     * @param config the set of variables that describe the configuration,
     *            contained in a {@link WifiConfiguration} object. It may
     *            be sparse, so that only the items that are being changed
     *            are non-<code>null</code>. The {@code networkId} field
     *            must be set to the ID of the existing network being updated.
     *            If the {@link WifiConfiguration} has an Http Proxy set
     *            the calling app must be System, or be provisioned as the Profile or Device Owner.
     * @return Returns the {@code networkId} of the supplied
     *         {@code WifiConfiguration} on success.
     *         <br/>
     *         Returns {@code -1} on failure, including when the {@code networkId}
     *         field of the {@code WifiConfiguration} does not refer to an
     *         existing network.
