     * Check if the device allows for tethering. It may be disabled via {@code ro.tether.denied}
     * system property, Settings.TETHER_SUPPORTED or due to device configuration. This is useful
     * for system components that query this API on behalf of an app. In particular, Bluetooth
     * has @UnsupportedAppUsage calls that will let apps turn on bluetooth tethering if they have
     * the right permissions, but such an app needs to know whether it can (permissions as well
     * as support from the device) turn on tethering in the first place to show the appropriate UI.
     *
     * @param callerPkg The caller package name, if it is not matching the calling uid,
     *       SecurityException would be thrown.
     * @return a boolean - {@code true} indicating Tethering is supported.
