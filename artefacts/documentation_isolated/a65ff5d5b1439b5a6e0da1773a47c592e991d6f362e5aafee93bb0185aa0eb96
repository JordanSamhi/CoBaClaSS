         * Handles loss of a session
         *
         * <p>The loss of a session might be due to an onLost() call, the IKE session getting torn
         * down for any reason, or an error in updating state (transform application, VPN setup)
         *
         * <p>This method MUST always be called on the mExecutor thread in order to ensure
         * consistency of the Ikev2VpnRunner fields.
