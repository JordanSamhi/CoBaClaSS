     * Must be called at any entry points on {@link ShortcutManager} APIs to make sure the
     * information on the package is up-to-date.
     *
     * We use broadcasts to handle locale changes and package changes, but because broadcasts
     * are asynchronous, there's a chance a publisher calls getXxxShortcuts() after a certain event
     * (e.g. system locale change) but shortcut manager hasn't finished processing the broadcast.
     *
     * So we call this method at all entry points from publishers to make sure we update all
     * relevant information.
     *
     * Similar inconsistencies can happen when the launcher fetches shortcut information, but
     * that's a less of an issue because for the launcher we report shortcut changes with
     * callbacks.
