         * @param asSystemService {@code true} if the event sent to the session came from the
         *          service instead of the app process. This helps sessions to distinguish between
         *          the key injection by the app and key events from the hardware devices. Should be
         *          used only when the hardware key events aren't handled by foreground activity.

         * @param keyEvent a non-null KeyEvent whose key code is one of the
         *            supported media buttons
         * @param needWakeLock true if a PARTIAL_WAKE_LOCK needs to be held
         *            while this key event is dispatched.
