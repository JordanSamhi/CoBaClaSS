     * {@link #getId()}, or throws an IllegalArgumentException if the ID is invalid or there is no
     * matching view in the hierarchy.

     * <strong>Note:</strong> In most cases -- depending on compiler support --
     * the resulting view is automatically cast to the target class type. If
     * the target class type is unconstrained, an explicit cast may be
     * necessary.
