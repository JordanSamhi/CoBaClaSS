     * Returns the IWifiChip corresponding to the specified interface (or null on error).
     *
     * Note: clients must not perform chip mode changes or interface management (create/delete)
     * operations on IWifiChip directly. However, they can use the IWifiChip interface to perform
     * other functions - e.g. calling the debug/trace methods.
