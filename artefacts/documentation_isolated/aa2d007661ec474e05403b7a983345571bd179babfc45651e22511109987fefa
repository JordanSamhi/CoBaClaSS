     * Adds a view item to this grid, placing it in the correct sublist and ensuring that the
     * sublist is visible.
     *
     * This function is stateful, since it tracks how many items have been added thus far, to
     * determine which sublist they should be added to. To ensure that this works correctly, call
     * removeAllItems() instead of removing views individually with removeView() to ensure that the
     * counter gets reset correctly.
     * @param item
