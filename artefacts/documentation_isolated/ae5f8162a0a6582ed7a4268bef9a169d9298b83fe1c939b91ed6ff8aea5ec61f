     * Creates a Bundle that represents the given Bitmap.
     * <p>The Bundle will contain a wrapped version of the Bitmaps HardwareBuffer, so will avoid
     * copies when passing across processes, only pass to processes you trust.
     *
     * <p>Returns a new Bundle rather than modifying an exiting one to avoid key collisions, the
     * returned Bundle should be treated as a standalone object.
     *
     * @param bitmap to convert to bundle
     * @return a Bundle representing the bitmap, should only be parsed by
     *         {@link #bundleToHardwareBitmap(Bundle)}
