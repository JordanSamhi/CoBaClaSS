     * Look for a child view that matches the specified predicate,
     * starting with the specified view and its descendents and then
     * recusively searching the ancestors and siblings of that view
     * until this view is reached.
     *
     * This method is useful in cases where the predicate does not match
     * a single unique view (perhaps multiple views use the same id)
     * and we are trying to find the view that is "closest" in scope to the
     * starting view.
     *
     * @param start The view to start from.
     * @param predicate The predicate to evaluate.
     * @return The first view that matches the predicate or null.
     * @hide
