     * Create a p2p group with the current device as the group owner. This essentially creates
     * an access point that can accept connections from legacy clients as well as other p2p
     * devices.
     *
     * <p> An app should use {@link WifiP2pConfig.Builder} to build the configuration
     * for a group.
     *
     * <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong>
     * This function would normally not be used unless the current device needs
     * to form a p2p group as a Group Owner and allow peers to join it as either
     * Group Clients or legacy Wi-Fi STAs.
     *
     * <p> The function call immediately returns after sending a group creation request
     * to the framework. The application is notified of a success or failure to initiate
     * group creation through listener callbacks {@link ActionListener#onSuccess} or
     * {@link ActionListener#onFailure}.
     *
     * <p> Application can request for the group details with {@link #requestGroupInfo}.
     *
     * @param c is the channel created at {@link #initialize}.
     * @param config the configuration of a p2p group.
     * @param listener for callbacks on success or failure. Can be null.
