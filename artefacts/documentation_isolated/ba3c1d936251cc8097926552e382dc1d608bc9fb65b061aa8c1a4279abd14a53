     * Reads 3 bytes in *little endian format* from the stream and composes a 24-bit integer.
     * As we are storing the 3-byte value in a 4-byte integer, the upper byte is always
     * 0, essentially making the returned value *unsigned*.
     * @return The 24-bit integer (packed into the lower 3 bytes of an int) encoded by the
     * next 3 bytes in the stream.
     * @throws IndexOutOfBoundsException
