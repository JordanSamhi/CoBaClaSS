     * Called when the scroll state of this RecyclerView changes. Subclasses should use this
     * method to respond to state changes instead of an explicit listener.
     *
     * <p>This method will always be invoked before listeners, but after the LayoutManager
     * responds to the scroll state change.</p>
     *
     * @param state the new scroll state, one of {@link #SCROLL_STATE_IDLE},
     *              {@link #SCROLL_STATE_DRAGGING} or {@link #SCROLL_STATE_SETTLING}
