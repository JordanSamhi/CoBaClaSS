     * Gets the current timeout for waiting for a widget to become visible in
     * the user interface so that it can be matched by a selector.
     *
     * Because user interface content is dynamic, sometimes a widget may not
     * be visible immediately and won't be detected by a selector. This timeout
     * allows the uiautomator framework to wait for a match to be found, up until
     * the timeout elapses.
     *
     * @return Current timeout value in milliseconds
