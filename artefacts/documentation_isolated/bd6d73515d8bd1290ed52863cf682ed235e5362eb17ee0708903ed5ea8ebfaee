     * Returns fine-grained carrier id of the current subscription. Carrier ids with a valid parent
     * id are specific carrier ids.
     *
     * A specific carrier ID can represent the fact that a carrier may be in effect an aggregation
     * of other carriers (ie in an MVNO type scenario) where each of these specific carriers which
     * are used to make up the actual carrier service may have different carrier configurations.
     * A specific carrier ID could also be used, for example, in a scenario where a carrier requires
     * different carrier configuration for different service offering such as a prepaid plan.
     * e.g, {@link #getCarrierId()} will always return Tracfone (id 2022) for a Tracfone SIM, while
     * {@link #getSpecificCarrierId()} can return Tracfone AT&T or Tracfone T-Mobile based on the
     * IMSI from the current subscription.
     *
     * For carriers without any fine-grained carrier ids, return {@link #getCarrierId()}
