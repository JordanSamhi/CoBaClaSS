    * Tell the client that the quota has been exceeded for the Web SQL Database
    * API for a particular origin and request a new quota. The client must
    * respond by invoking the
    * {@link WebStorage.QuotaUpdater#updateQuota(long) updateQuota(long)}
    * method of the supplied {@link WebStorage.QuotaUpdater} instance. The
    * minimum value that can be set for the new quota is the current quota. The
    * default implementation responds with the current quota, so the quota will
    * not be increased.
    * @param url The URL of the page that triggered the notification
    * @param databaseIdentifier The identifier of the database where the quota
    *                           was exceeded.
    * @param quota The quota for the origin, in bytes
    * @param estimatedDatabaseSize The estimated size of the offending
    *                              database, in bytes
    * @param totalQuota The total quota for all origins, in bytes
    * @param quotaUpdater An instance of {@link WebStorage.QuotaUpdater} which
    *                     must be used to inform the WebView of the new quota.
    * @deprecated This method is no longer called; WebView now uses the HTML5 / JavaScript Quota
    *             Management API.
