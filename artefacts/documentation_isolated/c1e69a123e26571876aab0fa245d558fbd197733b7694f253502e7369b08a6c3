     * Set the domain_suffix_match directive on wpa_supplicant. This is the parameter to use
     * for Hotspot 2.0 defined matching of AAA server certs per WFA HS2.0 spec, section 7.3.3.2,
     * second paragraph.
     *
     * <p>From wpa_supplicant documentation:
     * <p>Constraint for server domain name. If set, this FQDN is used as a suffix match requirement
     * for the AAAserver certificate in SubjectAltName dNSName element(s). If a matching dNSName is
     * found, this constraint is met.
     * <p>Suffix match here means that the host/domain name is compared one label at a time starting
     * from the top-level domain and all the labels in domain_suffix_match shall be included in the
     * certificate. The certificate may include additional sub-level labels in addition to the
     * required labels.
     * <p>More than one match string can be provided by using semicolons to separate the strings
     * (e.g., example.org;example.com). When multiple strings are specified, a match with any one of
     * the values is considered a sufficient match for the certificate, i.e., the conditions are
     * ORed ogether.
     * <p>For example, domain_suffix_match=example.com would match test.example.com but would not
     * match test-example.com.
     *
     * Note: If no domain suffix is set for an Enterprise configuration, either by not calling this
     * API, or by calling it with null, or not setting alternate subject match using the
     * {@link #setAltSubjectMatch(String)}, then the server certificate
     * validation is incomplete - which means that the connection is not secure.
     *
     * @param domain The domain value
