     * Create a coarse location using two technique, random offsets and snap-to-grid.
     *
     * First we add a random offset to mitigate against detecting grid transitions. Without a random
     * offset it is possible to detect a user's position quite accurately when they cross a grid
     * boundary. The random offset changes very slowly over time, to mitigate against taking many
     * location samples and averaging them out. Second we snap-to-grid (quantize). This has the nice
     * property of producing stable results, and mitigating against taking many samples to average
     * out a random offset.
