     * For backward compatibility, since some apps don't include 6GHz in their requests yet,
     * lacking 6GHz band does not cause the result to be false.
     *
     * @param bandScanned bands that are fully scanned
     * @param excludeDfs when true, DFS band is excluded from the check
     * @return true if all bands are scanned, false otherwise
