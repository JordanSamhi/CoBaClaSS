     * Returns the time (millis since epoch) of the last occurrence,
     * or -1 if the event repeats forever.  If there are no occurrences
     * (because the exrule or exdates cancel all the occurrences) and the
     * event does not repeat forever, then 0 is returned.
     *
     * This computes a conservative estimate of the last occurrence. That is,
     * the time of the actual last occurrence might be earlier than the time
     * returned by this method.
     *
     * @param dtstart the time of the first occurrence
     * @param recur the recurrence
     * @return an estimate of the time (in UTC milliseconds) of the last
     * occurrence, which may be greater than the actual last occurrence
     * @throws DateException
