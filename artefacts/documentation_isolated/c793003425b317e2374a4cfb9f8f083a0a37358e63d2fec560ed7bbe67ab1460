     * Stops the monitor from listening for driving state changes. This will only occur after a
     * set delay so that calling stop/start in quick succession doesn't actually need to reconnect
     * to the service repeatedly. This monitor also maintains parity between started and stopped so
     * 2 started calls requires two stop calls to stop.
