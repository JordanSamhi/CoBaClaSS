     * Pass device mobility state to WifiChannelUtilization and
     * alter the PNO scan interval based on the current device mobility state.
     * If the device is stationary, it will likely not find many new Wifi networks. Thus, increase
     * the interval between scans. Decrease the interval between scans if the device begins to move
     * again.
     * @param newState the new device mobility state
