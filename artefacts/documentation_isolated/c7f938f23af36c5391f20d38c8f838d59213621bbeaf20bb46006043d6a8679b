     * Validate the configuration received from an external application.
     *
     * This method checks for the following parameters:
     * 1. {@link WifiConfiguration#SSID}
     * 2. {@link WifiConfiguration#BSSID}
     * 3. {@link WifiConfiguration#preSharedKey}
     * 4. {@link WifiConfiguration#allowedKeyManagement}
     * 5. {@link WifiConfiguration#allowedProtocols}
     * 6. {@link WifiConfiguration#allowedAuthAlgorithms}
     * 7. {@link WifiConfiguration#allowedGroupCiphers}
     * 8. {@link WifiConfiguration#allowedPairwiseCiphers}
     * 9. {@link WifiConfiguration#getIpConfiguration()}
     *
     * @param config {@link WifiConfiguration} received from an external application.
     * @param isAdd {@link #VALIDATE_FOR_ADD} to indicate a network config received for an add,
     *              {@link #VALIDATE_FOR_UPDATE} for a network config received for an update.
     *              These 2 cases need to be handled differently because the config received for an
     *              update could contain only the fields that are being changed.
     * @return true if the parameters are valid, false otherwise.
