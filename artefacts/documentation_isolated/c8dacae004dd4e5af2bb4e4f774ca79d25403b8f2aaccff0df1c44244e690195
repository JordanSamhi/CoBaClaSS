     * Sets the timeout for waiting for the user interface to go into an idle
     * state before starting a uiautomator action.
     *
     * By default, all core uiautomator objects except {@link UiDevice} will perform
     * this wait before starting to search for the widget specified by the
     * object's {@link UiSelector}. Once the idle state is detected or the
     * timeout elapses (whichever occurs first), the object will start to wait
     * for the selector to find a match.
     * See {@link #setWaitForSelectorTimeout(long)}
