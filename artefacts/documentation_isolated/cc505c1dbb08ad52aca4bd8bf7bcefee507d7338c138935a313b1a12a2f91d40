   * Creates an {@link OnClickListener} which if scrolling is required, will scroll the page down,
   * and if scrolling is not required, delegates to the wrapped {@code listener}. Note that you
   * should call {@link #requireScroll()} as well in order to start requiring scrolling.
   *
   * @param listener The listener to be invoked when scrolling is not needed and the user taps on
   *     the button. If {@code null}, the click listener will be a no-op when scroll is not
   *     required.
   * @return A new {@link OnClickListener} which will scroll the page down or delegate to the given
   *     listener depending on the current require-scroll state.
