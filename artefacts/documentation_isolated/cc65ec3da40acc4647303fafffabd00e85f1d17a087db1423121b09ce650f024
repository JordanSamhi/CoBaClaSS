         * Configure whether the publish discovery session supports ranging and allows peers to
         * measure distance to it. This API is used in conjunction with
         * {@link SubscribeConfig.Builder#setMinDistanceMm(int)} and
         * {@link SubscribeConfig.Builder#setMaxDistanceMm(int)} to specify a minimum and/or
         * maximum distance at which discovery will be triggered.
         * <p>
         * Optional. Disabled by default - i.e. any peer attempt to measure distance to this device
         * will be refused and discovery will proceed without ranging constraints.
         * <p>
         * The device must support Wi-Fi RTT for this feature to be used. Feature support is checked
         * as described in {@link android.net.wifi.rtt}.
         *
         * @param enable If true, ranging is supported on request of the peer.
         *
         * @return The builder to facilitate chaining
         *         {@code builder.setXXX(..).setXXX(..)}.
