     * Waits a specified length of time for a view to become undetectable.
     *
     * This method waits until a view is no longer matchable, or until the
     * timeout has elapsed.
     *
     * A view becomes undetectable when the {@link UiSelector} of the object is
     * unable to find a match because the element has either changed its state or is no
     * longer displayed.
     *
     * You can use this method when attempting to wait for some long operation
     * to compete, such as downloading a large file or connecting to a remote server.
     *
     * @param timeout time to wait (in milliseconds)
     * @return true if the element is gone before timeout elapsed, else false if timeout elapsed
     * but a matching element is still found.
     * @since API Level 16
