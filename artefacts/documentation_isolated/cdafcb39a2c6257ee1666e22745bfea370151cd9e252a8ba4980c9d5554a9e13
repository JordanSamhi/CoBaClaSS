     * Called to set an application's VR thread.
     *
     * <p>This will fail if the system is not in VR mode, the system has the persistent VR flag set,
     * or the scheduling group of the thread is not for the current top app.  If this succeeds, any
     * previous VR thread will be returned to a normal sheduling priority; if this fails, the
     * scheduling for the previous thread will be unaffected.
     *
     * <p>Note: This must be called with the global ActivityManagerService lock and the
     *     mPidsSelfLocked object locks held.
     *
     * @param tid the tid of the thread to set, or 0 to unset the current thread.
     * @param pid the pid of the process owning the thread to set.
     * @param proc the WindowProcessController of the process owning the thread to set.
