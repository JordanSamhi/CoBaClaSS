     * Overridable function to provide complex filtering.
     * Called for every request every time a new NetworkRequest is seen
     * and whenever the filterScore or filterNetworkCapabilities change.
     *
     * acceptRequest can be overridden to provide complex filter behavior
     * for the incoming requests
     *
     * For output, this class will call {@link #needNetworkFor} and
     * {@link #releaseNetworkFor} for every request that passes the filters.
     * If you don't need to see every request, you can leave the base
     * implementations of those two functions and instead override
     * {@link #startNetwork} and {@link #stopNetwork}.
     *
     * If you want to see every score fluctuation on every request, set
     * your score filter to a very high number and watch {@link #needNetworkFor}.
     *
     * @return {@code true} to accept the request.
