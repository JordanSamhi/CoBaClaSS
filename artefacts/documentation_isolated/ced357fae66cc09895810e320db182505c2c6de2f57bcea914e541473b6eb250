     * Sets up basic mocks for {@link UserBackupManagerService} mock. If {@code
     * backupManagerService} is a spy, make sure you provide in the arguments the same objects that
     * the original object uses.

     * <p>If the class-under-test is going to execute methods as the system, it's a good idea to
     * also call {@link #setUpBinderCallerAndApplicationAsSystem(Application)}.
