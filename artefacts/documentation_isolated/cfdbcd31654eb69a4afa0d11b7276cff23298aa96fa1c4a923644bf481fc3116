     * Modify the current clip with the specified rectangle.
     *
     * @param rect The rect to intersect with the current clip
     * @param op How the clip is modified
     * @return true if the resulting clip is non-empty
     *
     * @deprecated Region.Op values other than {@link Region.Op#INTERSECT} and
     * {@link Region.Op#DIFFERENCE} have the ability to expand the clip. The canvas clipping APIs
     * are intended to only expand the clip as a result of a restore operation. This enables a view
     * parent to clip a canvas to clearly define the maximal drawing area of its children. The
     * recommended alternative calls are {@link #clipRect(RectF)} and {@link #clipOutRect(RectF)};
     *
     * As of API Level API level {@value Build.VERSION_CODES#P} only {@link Region.Op#INTERSECT} and
     * {@link Region.Op#DIFFERENCE} are valid Region.Op parameters.
