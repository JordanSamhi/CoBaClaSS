     * This method will copy temporary test config and temporary override network watchlist config
     * in memory. When device is rebooted, temporary test config will be removed, and system will
     * use back the original watchlist config.
     * Also, as temporary network watchlist config is not secure, we will mark it as insecure
     * config and will be applied to testOnly applications only.
