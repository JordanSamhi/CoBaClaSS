         * Add a device specified by a {@link PeerHandle} to the list of devices with which to
         * measure range.
         * <p>
         * The {@link PeerHandle} may be obtained as part of the Wi-Fi Aware discovery process. E.g.
         * using {@link DiscoverySessionCallback#onServiceDiscovered(PeerHandle, byte[], List)}.
         * <p>
         * Note: in order to use this API the device must support Wi-Fi Aware
         * {@link android.net.wifi.aware}. The peer device which is being ranged to must be
         * configured to publish a service (with any name) with:
         * <li>Type {@link android.net.wifi.aware.PublishConfig#PUBLISH_TYPE_UNSOLICITED}.
         * <li>Ranging enabled
         * {@link android.net.wifi.aware.PublishConfig.Builder#setRangingEnabled(boolean)}.
         *
         * @param peerHandle The peer handler of the peer Wi-Fi Aware device.
         * @return The builder, to facilitate chaining {@code builder.setXXX(..).setXXX(..)}.
