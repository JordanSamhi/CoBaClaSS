     * Record that this token has been acquired for the given user.  When acquire is called, and
     * the user's count goes from 0 to 1, the acquired callback is called on the given
     * handler.
     *
     * Note that the same {@code token} can only be acquired once per user. If this
     * {@code token} has already been acquired for the given user, no action is taken. The first
     * subsequent call to {@link #release} will release this {@code token}
     * immediately.
     *
     * @param token  An IBinder object.
     * @param tag    A string used by the {@link #dump} method for debugging,
     *               to see who has references.
     * @param userId A user id
