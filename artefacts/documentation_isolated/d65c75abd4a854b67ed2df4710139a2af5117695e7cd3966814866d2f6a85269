     * Specify a X.509 certificate that identifies the server.
     *
     * <p>A default name is automatically assigned to the certificate and used
     * with this configuration. The framework takes care of installing the
     * certificate when the config is saved and removing the certificate when
     * the config is removed.
     *
     * Note: If no certificate is set for an Enterprise configuration, either by not calling this
     * API (or the {@link #setCaCertificates(X509Certificate[])}, or by calling it with null, then
     * the server certificate validation is skipped - which means that the connection is not secure.
