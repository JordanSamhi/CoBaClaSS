     * This method returns the drawing rect for the view which is different from the regular
     * drawing rect, since we layout all children in the {@link NotificationStackScrollLayout} at
     * position 0 and usually the translation is neglected. Since we are manually clipping this
     * view,we also need to subtract the clipTopAmount from the top. This is needed in order to
     * ensure that accessibility and focusing work correctly.
     *
     * @param outRect The (scrolled) drawing bounds of the view.
