     * Constructs and returns an ObjectAnimator that animates between color values. A single
     * value implies that that value is the one being animated to, in which case the start value
     * will be derived from the property being animated and the target object when {@link #start()}
     * is called for the first time. Two values imply starting and ending values. More than two
     * values imply a starting value, values to animate through along the way, and an ending value
     * (these values will be distributed evenly across the duration of the animation).
     *
     * @param target The object whose property is to be animated.
     * @param property The property being animated.
     * @param values A set of values that the animation will animate between over time.
     * @return An ObjectAnimator object that is set up to animate between the given values.
