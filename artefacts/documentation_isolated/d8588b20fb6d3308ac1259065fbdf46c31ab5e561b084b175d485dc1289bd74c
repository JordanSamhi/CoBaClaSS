     * Constructs and returns an ObjectAnimator that animates coordinates along a <code>Path</code>
     * using two properties.  A <code>Path</code></> animation moves in two dimensions, animating
     * coordinates <code>(x, y)</code> together to follow the line. In this variation, the
     * coordinates are integers that are set to separate properties, <code>xProperty</code> and
     * <code>yProperty</code>.
     *
     * @param target The object whose properties are to be animated.
     * @param xProperty The property for the x coordinate being animated.
     * @param yProperty The property for the y coordinate being animated.
     * @param path The <code>Path</code> to animate values along.
     * @return An ObjectAnimator object that is set up to animate along <code>path</code>.
