     * Sends an arbitrary 802.11 management frame on the current channel.
     *
     * @param ifaceName Name of the interface.
     * @param frame Bytes of the 802.11 management frame to be sent, including the header, but not
     *              including the frame check sequence (FCS).
     * @param callback A callback triggered when the transmitted frame is ACKed or the transmission
     *                 fails.
     * @param mcs The MCS index that the frame will be sent at. If mcs < 0, the driver will select
     *            the rate automatically. If the device does not support sending the frame at a
     *            specified MCS rate, the transmission will be aborted and
     *            {@link WifiNl80211Manager.SendMgmtFrameCallback#onFailure(int)} will be called
     *            with reason {@link WifiNl80211Manager#SEND_MGMT_FRAME_ERROR_MCS_UNSUPPORTED}.
