     * Convert a IPv4 address from an InetAddress to an integer (1.2.3.4 -> 0x04030201)
     *
     * <p>This method stores the higher-order IPv4 address bytes in the lower-order int bytes,
     * which is an unusual convention. Consider {@link #inet4AddressToIntHTH(Inet4Address)} instead.
     * @param inetAddr is an InetAddress corresponding to the IPv4 address
     * @return the IP address as integer
