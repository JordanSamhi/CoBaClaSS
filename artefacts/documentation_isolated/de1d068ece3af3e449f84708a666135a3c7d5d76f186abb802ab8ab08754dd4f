     * Verifies that logcat has produced log items as specified per level in {@code logs} (with
     * repetition).
     *
     * <p>So, if you call {@code assertLogcat(TAG, Log.ERROR, Log.ERROR)}, you assert that there are
     * exactly 2 log items, each with level ERROR.
     *
     * <p>Reset logcat with {@link ShadowLog#reset()} before the test case if you do anything
     * that uses logcat before that.
