   * Use the given {@code button} to require scrolling. When scrolling is required, the button label
   * will change to {@code moreText}, and tapping the button will cause the page to scroll down.
   *
   * <p>Note: Calling {@link View#setOnClickListener} on the button after this method will remove
   * its link to the require-scroll mechanism. If you need to do that, obtain the click listener
   * from {@link #createOnClickListener(OnClickListener)}.
   *
   * <p>Note: The normal button label is taken from the button's text at the time of calling this
   * method. Calling {@link android.widget.TextView#setText} after calling this method causes
   * undefined behavior.
   *
   * @param button The button to use for require scroll. The button's "normal" label is taken from
   *     the text at the time of calling this method, and the click listener of it will be replaced.
   * @param moreText The button label when scroll is required.
   * @param onClickListener The listener for clicks when scrolling is not required.
