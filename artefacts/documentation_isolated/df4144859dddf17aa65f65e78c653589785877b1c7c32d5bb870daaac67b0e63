     * Tracks a request to pause the video for a source (see {@link #SOURCE_DATA_ENABLED},
     * {@link #SOURCE_INCALL}) and determines whether a pause request should be issued to the
     * video provider.
     *
     * We want to issue a pause request to the provider when we receive the first request
     * to pause via any source and we're not already paused.
     *
     * @param source The source of the pause request.
     * @return {@code true} if a pause should be issued to the
     *      {@link ImsVideoCallProvider}, {@code false} otherwise.
