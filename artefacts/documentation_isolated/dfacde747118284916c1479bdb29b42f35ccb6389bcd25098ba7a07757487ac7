     * <p>Create a {@link CaptureRequest.Builder} for new capture requests,
     * initialized with template for a target use case. This methods allows
     * clients to pass physical camera ids which can be used to customize the
     * request for a specific physical camera. The settings are chosen
     * to be the best options for the specific logical camera device. If
     * additional physical camera ids are passed, then they will also use the
     * same settings template. Clients can further modify individual camera
     * settings by calling {@link CaptureRequest.Builder#setPhysicalCameraKey}.</p>
     *
     * <p>Individual physical camera settings will only be honored for camera session
     * that was initialiazed with corresponding physical camera id output configuration
     * {@link OutputConfiguration#setPhysicalCameraId} and the same output targets are
     * also attached in the request by {@link CaptureRequest.Builder#addTarget}.</p>
     *
     * <p>The output is undefined for any logical camera streams in case valid physical camera
     * settings are attached.</p>
     *
     * @param templateType An enumeration selecting the use case for this request. Not all template
     * types are supported on every device. See the documentation for each template type for
     * details.
     * @param physicalCameraIdSet A set of physical camera ids that can be used to customize
     *                            the request for a specific physical camera.
     * @return a builder for a capture request, initialized with default
     * settings for that template, and no output streams
     *
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if the templateType is not supported by
     * this device, or one of the physical id arguments matches with logical camera id.
     * @throws CameraAccessException if the camera device is no longer connected or has
     *                               encountered a fatal error
     * @throws IllegalStateException if the camera device has been closed
