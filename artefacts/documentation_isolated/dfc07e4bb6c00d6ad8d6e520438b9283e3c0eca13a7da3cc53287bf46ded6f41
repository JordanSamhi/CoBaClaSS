     * Calculates the level of the signal. This should be used any time a signal
     * is being shown.
     *
     * @param rssi The power of the signal measured in RSSI.
     * @param numLevels The number of levels to consider in the calculated level.
     * @return A level of the signal, given in the range of 0 to numLevels-1 (both inclusive).
     * @deprecated Callers should use {@link #calculateSignalLevel(int)} instead to get the
     * signal level using the system default RSSI thresholds, or otherwise compute the RSSI level
     * themselves using their own formula.
