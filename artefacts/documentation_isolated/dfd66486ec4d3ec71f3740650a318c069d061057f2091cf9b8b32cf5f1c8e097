     * Returns a {@link java.util.Set Set} view of the keys contained in this MediaFormat.
     *
     * The set is backed by the MediaFormat object, so changes to the format are reflected in the
     * set, and vice-versa. If the format is modified while an iteration over the set is in progress
     * (except through the iterator's own remove operation), the results of the iteration are
     * undefined. The set supports element removal, which removes the corresponding mapping from the
     * format, via the Iterator.remove, Set.remove, removeAll, retainAll, and clear operations.
     * It does not support the add or addAll operations.
