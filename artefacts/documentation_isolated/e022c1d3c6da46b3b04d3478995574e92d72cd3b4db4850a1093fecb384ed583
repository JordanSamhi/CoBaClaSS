     * Called by ConnectivityService to start TCP keepalive on a file descriptor.
     *
     * In order to offload keepalive for application correctly, sequence number, ack number and
     * other fields are needed to form the keepalive packet. Thus, this function synchronously
     * puts the socket into repair mode to get the necessary information. After the socket has been
     * put into repair mode, the application cannot access the socket until reverted to normal.
     *
     * See {@link android.net.SocketKeepalive}.
