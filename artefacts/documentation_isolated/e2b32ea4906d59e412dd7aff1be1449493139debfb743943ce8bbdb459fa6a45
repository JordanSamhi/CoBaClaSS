     * @return The standard deviation of the measured distance (in mm) to the device specified by
     * {@link #getMacAddress()} or {@link #getPeerHandle()}. The standard deviation is calculated
     * over the measurements executed in a single RTT burst. The number of measurements is returned
     * by {@link #getNumSuccessfulMeasurements()} - 0 successful measurements indicate that the
     * standard deviation is not valid (a valid standard deviation requires at least 2 data points).
     * <p>
     * Only valid if {@link #getStatus()} returns {@link #STATUS_SUCCESS}, otherwise will throw an
     * exception.
