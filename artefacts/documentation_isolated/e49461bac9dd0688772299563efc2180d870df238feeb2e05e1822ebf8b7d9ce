     * Compute the sample size as a function of minSideLength
     * and maxNumOfPixels.
     * minSideLength is used to specify that minimal width or height of a
     * bitmap.
     * maxNumOfPixels is used to specify the maximal size in pixels that is
     * tolerable in terms of memory usage.
     *
     * The function returns a sample size based on the constraints.
     * Both size and minSideLength can be passed in as UNCONSTRAINED,
     * which indicates no care of the corresponding constraint.
     * The functions prefers returning a sample size that
     * generates a smaller bitmap, unless minSideLength = UNCONSTRAINED.
     *
     * Also, the function rounds up the sample size to a power of 2 or multiple
     * of 8 because BitmapFactory only honors sample size this way.
     * For example, BitmapFactory downsamples an image by 2 even though the
     * request is 3. So we round up the sample size to avoid OOM.
