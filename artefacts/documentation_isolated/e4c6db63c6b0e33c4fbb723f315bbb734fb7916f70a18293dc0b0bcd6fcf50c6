     * Removes empty spans from the <code>spans</code> array.
     *
     * When parsing a Spanned using {@link Spanned#nextSpanTransition(int, int, Class)}, empty spans
     * will (correctly) create span transitions, and calling getSpans on a slice of text bounded by
     * one of these transitions will (correctly) include the empty overlapping span.
     *
     * However, these empty spans should not be taken into account when layouting or rendering the
     * string and this method provides a way to filter getSpans' results accordingly.
     *
     * @param spans A list of spans retrieved using {@link Spanned#getSpans(int, int, Class)} from
     * the <code>spanned</code>
     * @param spanned The Spanned from which spans were extracted
     * @return A subset of spans where empty spans ({@link Spanned#getSpanStart(Object)}  ==
     * {@link Spanned#getSpanEnd(Object)} have been removed. The initial order is preserved
     * @hide
