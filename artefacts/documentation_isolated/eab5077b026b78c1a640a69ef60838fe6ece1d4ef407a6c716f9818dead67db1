     * Initiate service discovery. A discovery process involves scanning for
     * requested services for the purpose of establishing a connection to a peer
     * that supports an available service.
     *
     * <p> The function call immediately returns after sending a request to start service
     * discovery to the framework. The application is notified of a success or failure to initiate
     * discovery through listener callbacks {@link ActionListener#onSuccess} or
     * {@link ActionListener#onFailure}.
     *
     * <p> The services to be discovered are specified with calls to {@link #addServiceRequest}.
     *
     * <p>The application is notified of the response against the service discovery request
     * through listener callbacks registered by {@link #setServiceResponseListener} or
     * {@link #setDnsSdResponseListeners}, or {@link #setUpnpServiceResponseListener}.
     *
     * @param c is the channel created at {@link #initialize}
     * @param listener for callbacks on success or failure. Can be null.
