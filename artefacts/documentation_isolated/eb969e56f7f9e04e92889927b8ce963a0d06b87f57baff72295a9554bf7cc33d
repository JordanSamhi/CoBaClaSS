     * Filters the given items based on language preferences.
     *
     * <p>For each language found in {@code preferredLocales}, this method tries to copy at most
     * one best-match item from {@code source} to {@code dest}.  For example, if
     * {@code "en-GB", "ja", "en-AU", "fr-CA", "en-IN"} is specified to {@code preferredLocales},
     * this method tries to copy at most one English locale, at most one Japanese, and at most one
     * French locale from {@code source} to {@code dest}.  Here the best matching English locale
     * will be searched from {@code source} based on matching score. For the score design, see
     * {@link LocaleUtils#calculateMatchingSubScore(ULocale, ULocale)}</p>
     *
     * @param sources Source items to be filtered.
