     * Constructs and returns an ObjectAnimator that animates between Object values. A single
     * value implies that that value is the one being animated to, in which case the start value
     * will be derived from the property being animated and the target object when {@link #start()}
     * is called for the first time. Two values imply starting and ending values. More than two
     * values imply a starting value, values to animate through along the way, and an ending value
     * (these values will be distributed evenly across the duration of the animation).
     * This variant supplies a <code>TypeConverter</code> to convert from the animated values to the
     * type of the property. If only one value is supplied, the <code>TypeConverter</code> must be a
     * {@link android.animation.BidirectionalTypeConverter} to retrieve the current value.
     *
     * <p><strong>Note:</strong> The values are stored as references to the original
     * objects, which means that changes to those objects after this method is called will
     * affect the values on the animator. If the objects will be mutated externally after
     * this method is called, callers should pass a copy of those objects instead.
     *
     * @param target The object whose property is to be animated.
     * @param property The property being animated.
     * @param converter Converts the animated object to the Property type.
     * @param evaluator A TypeEvaluator that will be called on each animation frame to
     * provide the necessary interpolation between the Object values to derive the animated
     * value.
     * @param values A set of values that the animation will animate between over time.
     * @return An ObjectAnimator object that is set up to animate between the given values.
