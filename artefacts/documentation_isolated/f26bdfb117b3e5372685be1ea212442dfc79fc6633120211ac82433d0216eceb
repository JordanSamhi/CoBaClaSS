     * Registers the operation that is called to retrieve the metrics data. This must be called
     * each time statsd starts. The config must have been added first (via {@link #addConfig},
     * although addConfig could have been called on a previous boot). This operation allows
     * statsd to send metrics data whenever statsd determines that the metrics in memory are
     * approaching the memory limits. The fetch operation should call {@link #getReports} to fetch
     * the data, which also deletes the retrieved metrics from statsd's memory.
     *
     * @param pendingIntent the PendingIntent to use when broadcasting info to the subscriber
     *                      associated with the given subscriberId. May be null, in which case
     *                      it removes any associated pending intent with this configKey.
     * @param configKey     The integer naming the config to which this operation is attached.
     * @throws StatsUnavailableException if unsuccessful due to failing to connect to stats service
