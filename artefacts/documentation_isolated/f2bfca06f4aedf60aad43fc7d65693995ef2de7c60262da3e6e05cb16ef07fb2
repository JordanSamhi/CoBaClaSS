     * A fucntion of type getPhoneProp(propType) where propType is an
     * enum of GSM+CDMA+LTE props would be a better approach.
     *
     * Get "Restriction of menu options for manual PLMN selection" bit
     * status from EF_CSP data, this belongs to "Value Added Services Group".
     * @return true if this bit is set or EF_CSP data is unavailable,
     * false otherwise
