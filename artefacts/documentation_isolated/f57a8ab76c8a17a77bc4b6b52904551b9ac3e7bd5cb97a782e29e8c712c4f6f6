     * Switch the Default data for the context of an outgoing emergency call.
     *
     * In some cases, we need to try to switch the Default Data subscription before placing the
     * emergency call on DSDS devices. This includes the following situation:
     * - The modem does not support processing GNSS SUPL requests on the non-default data
     * subscription. For some carriers that do not provide a control plane fallback mechanism, the
     * SUPL request will be dropped and we will not be able to get the user's location for the
     * emergency call. In this case, we need to swap default data temporarily.
     * @param phoneId The phone to use to evaluate whether or not the default data should be moved
     *                to this subscription.
     * @param overrideTimeSec The amount of time to override the default data setting for after the
     *                       emergency call ends.
     * @param dataSwitchResult A {@link CompletableFuture} to be called with a {@link Boolean}
     *                         result when the default data switch has either completed (true) or
     *                         failed (false).
