     * Get the package dex usage for the given package name.
     * If there is no usage info the method will return a default {@code PackageUseInfo} with
     * no data about secondary dex files and marked as not being used by other apps.
     *
     * Note that no use info means the package was not used or it was used but not by other apps.
     * Also, note that right now we might prune packages which are not used by other apps.
     * TODO(calin): maybe we should not (prune) so we can have an accurate view when we try
     * to access the package use.
