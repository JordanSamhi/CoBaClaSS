     * As the only public entry point for permissions checking, this method
     * can enforce the semantic that requesting a check on a null global
     * permission is automatically denied.  (Internally a null permission
     * string is used when calling {@link #checkComponentPermission} in cases
     * when only uid-based security is needed.)
     *
     * This can be called with or without the global lock held.
