     * Splits a given rule list into three indexing categories. Each rule category is returned as a
     * TreeMap that is sorted by their indexing keys -- where keys correspond to package name for
     * PACKAGE_NAME_INDEXED rules, app certificate for APP_CERTIFICATE_INDEXED rules and N/A for
     * NOT_INDEXED rules.
