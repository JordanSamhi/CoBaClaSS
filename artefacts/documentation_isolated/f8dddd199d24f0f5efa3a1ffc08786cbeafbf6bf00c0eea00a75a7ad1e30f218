         * Animates a 'target' point that moves along the given path, using the provided duration
         * and interpolator to animate the target. The view itself is animated using physics-based
         * animations, whose final positions are updated to the target position as it animates. This
         * results in the view 'following' the target in a realistic way.
         *
         * This method will override earlier calls to {@link #translationX}, {@link #translationY},
         * or {@link #position}, ultimately animating the view's position to the final point on the
         * given path.
         *
         * @param pathAnimEndActions End actions to run after the animator that moves the target
         *                           along the path ends. The views following the target may still
         *                           be moving.
