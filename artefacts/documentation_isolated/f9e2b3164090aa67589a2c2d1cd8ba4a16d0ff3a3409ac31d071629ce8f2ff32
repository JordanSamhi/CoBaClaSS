         * untrusted network has its {@link android.net.NetworkCapabilities#NET_CAPABILITY_TRUSTED}

         * influence priority of the suggested network for Wi-Fi network selection (most likely to
         * reduce it). The connectivity service may use this information to influence the overall
         * network configuration of the device.
