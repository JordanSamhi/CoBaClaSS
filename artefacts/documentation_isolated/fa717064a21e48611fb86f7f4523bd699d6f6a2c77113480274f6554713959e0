     * Return true if the current phone supports distinct "Answer & Hold"
     * and "Answer & End" behaviors in the call-waiting scenario.  If so,
     * the in-call UI may provide separate buttons or menu items for these
     * two actions.
     *
     * Currently this is assumed to be true on GSM phones and false
     * otherwise.  (In particular, CDMA has no concept of explicitly
     * managing the background call, or "putting a call on hold.")
     *
     * TODO: It might be better to expose this capability in a more
     * generic form, like maybe "supportsExplicitMultipleLineManagement()"
     * rather than focusing specifically on call-waiting behavior.
