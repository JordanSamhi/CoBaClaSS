     * Performs dexopt on the secondary dex {@code path} belonging to the app {@code info}.
     *
     * @return
     *      DEX_OPT_FAILED if there was any exception during dexopt
     *      DEX_OPT_PERFORMED if dexopt was performed successfully on the given path.
     * NOTE that DEX_OPT_PERFORMED for secondary dex files includes the case when the dex file
     * didn't need an update. That's because at the moment we don't get more than success/failure
     * from installd.
     *
     * TODO(calin): Consider adding return codes to installd dexopt invocation (rather than
     * throwing exceptions). Or maybe make a separate call to installd to get DexOptNeeded, though
     * that seems wasteful.
