     * content views to be their low priority version or not.

     * Whether we inflate the low priority view or not depends on the notification being visually
     * part of a group. Since group membership is determined AFTER inflation, we're forced to check

     * the correct one here.
     *
     * TODO: The group manager should run before inflation so that we don't deal with this
